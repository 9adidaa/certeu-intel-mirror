This included access to BIG-IP product development source code and to information related to security vulnerabilities that had not yet been disclosed nor patched. F5 released patches on the same day to address the vulnerabilities [2].\n\nThere is currently no known exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CERT-EU strongly recommends to patch affected F5 products as soon as possible.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-53868**, with a CVSS score of 8.5, is affecting all modules of BIG-IP and could allow a highly privileged authenticated attacker with access to Secure Copy (SCP) protocol and SFTP to bypass Appliance mode restrictions using undisclosed commands. [3]\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-61955** and **CVE-2025-57780**, with a CVSS score of 8.5, are affecting F5OS and could allow an authenticated attacker with local access to escalate their privileges. A successful exploit may allow the attacker to cross a security boundary. [4,5]\n\nThe exhaustive list of vulnerabilities can be found in the F5 Quarterly Security Notification.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nBIG-IP, F5OS, BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes, BIG-IQ, and APM are affected by the vulnerabilities [1].\n\nRefer to F5's advisory for the list of all affected products. [2]\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends to apply updates on affected F5 products as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000154696>\n\n[2] <https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000156572#high>\n\n[3] <https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000151902>\n\n[4] <https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000156767>\n\n[5] <https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000156771>",
