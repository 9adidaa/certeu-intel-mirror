Citrix warns that exploits of CVE-2025-6543 on unmitigated appliances have been observed.\n\nIt is recommended updating affected assets as soon as possible.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-5777**, with a CVSS score of 9.3, is due to insufficient input validation leading to memory overread [1]. To be exploitable, NetScaler must be configured as Gateway (VPN virtual server, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy) OR AAA virtual server.\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-5349**, with a CVSS score of 8.7, is due to improper access control on the NetScaler Management Interface [1]. To exploit this vulnerability, it is necessary for an attacker to have access to the NSIP address, the Cluster Management IP or the local GSLB Site IP.\n\n**[New]** The vulnerability **CVE-2025-6543**, with a CVSS score of 9.2, is due to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer and leads to unintended control flow and Denial of Service [2]. To be exploitable, NetScaler must be configured as Gateway (VPN virtual server, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy) OR AAA virtual server.\n\n# Affected Products\n\n**[Updated]** The following products are affected by the vulnerabilities **CVE-2025-5777** and **CVE-2025-5349** [1]:\n\n- NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 14.1 BEFORE 14.1-43.56\n- NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1 BEFORE 13.1-58.32\n- NetScaler ADC 13.1-FIPS and NDcPP  BEFORE 13.1-37.235-FIPS and NDcPP\n- NetScaler ADC 12.1-FIPS BEFORE 12.1-55.328-FIPS\n\n**[New]** The following products are affected by the vulnerability **CVE-2025-6543** [2]:\n\n- NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 14.1 BEFORE 14.1-47.46\n- NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1 BEFORE 13.1-59.19\n- NetScaler ADC 13.1-FIPS and NDcPP  BEFORE 13.1-37.236-FIPS and NDcPP\n\n_Note: NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway versions 12.1 and 13.0 are End Of Life (EOL) and are vulnerable._\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended updating as soon as possible to the latest version of NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway.\n\nAdditionally, Citrix recommends running the following commands to terminate all active ICA and PCoIP sessions after all NetScaler appliances in the HA pair or cluster have been upgraded to the fixed builds:\n\n```\nkill icaconnection -all\nkill pcoipConnection -all\n```\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://support.citrix.com/support-home/kbsearch/article?articleNumber=CTX693420&articleTitle=NetScaler_ADC_and_NetScaler_Gateway_Security_Bulletin_for_CVE_2025_5349_and_CVE_2025_5777>\n\n[2] <https://support.citrix.com/support-home/kbsearch/article?articleNumber=CTX694788>",
