An attacker with access to a virtual machine could escape it to execute code on the host. Those vulnerabilities are being exploited in the wild [1].\n\nIt is recommended applying update as soon as possible.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability `CVE-2025-22224`, with a CVSS score of 9.3, is a TOCTOU (Time-of-Check Time-of-Use) vulnerability that leads to an out-of-bounds write. A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue to execute code as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host.\n\nThe vulnerability `CVE-2025-22225`, with a CVSS score of 8.2, is an arbitrary write vulnerability. A malicious actor with privileges within the VMX process may trigger an arbitrary kernel write leading to an escape of the sandbox.\n\nThe vulnerability `CVE-2025-22226`, with a CVSS score of 7.1, is an information disclosure vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds read in the Host Guest File System (HGFS). A malicious actor with administrative privileges to a virtual machine may be able to exploit this issue to leak memory from the vmx process. \n\n# Products Affected\n\nThose vulnerabilities effect :\n- VMware ESXi 7.0, 8.0\n- VMware Workstation 17.x\n- VMware Fusion 13.x\n- VMware Cloud Foundation 4.5.x, 5.x\n- VMware Telco Cloud Platform 5.x, 4.x, 3.x, 2.x\n- VMware Telco Cloud Infrastructure 3.x, 2.x \n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating to the latest version of the affected product as soon as possible to mitigate those vulnerabilities [1].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/25390>\n",
