The vulnerability is known to be exploited in the wild [1].\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2024-26009**, with a CVSS score of 7.9, is an authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel vulnerability and may allow an unauthenticated attacker to seize control of a managed device via crafted FGFM requests, if the device is managed by a FortiManager, and if the attacker knows that FortiManager's serial number [2].\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-52970**, with a CVSS score of 7.7, is due to improper handling of parameters and allows an unauthenticated remote attacker in possession of non-public information (pertaining to both the device and to the targeted user) to log in as any existing user on the device via a specially crafted request [3].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-25256** affects the following versions of FortiSIEM:\n\n- 7.3.0 through 7.3.1\n- 7.2.0 through 7.2.5\n- 7.1.0 through 7.1.7\n- 7.0.0 through 7.0.3\n- 6.7.0 through 6.7.9\n- 6.6, 6.5, 6.4, 6.3, 6.2 and 6.1\n- 5.4\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2024-26009** affects the following versions of FortiWeb:\n\n- 7.6.0 through 7.6.3\n- 7.4.0 through 7.4.7\n- 7.2.0 through 7.2.10\n- 7.0.0 through 7.0.10\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-52970** affects the following versions FortiOS, FortiPAM, FortiProxy and FortSwitch Manager:\n\n- FortiOS 6.4.0 through 6.4.15\n- FortiOS 6.2.0 through 6.2.16\n- FortiOS 6.0 all versions\n- FortiPAM 1.2 all versions\n- FortiPAM 1.1 all versions\n- FortiPAM 1.0 all versions\n- FortiProxy 7.4.0 through 7.4.2\n- FortiProxy 7.2.0 through 7.2.8\n- FortiProxy 7.0.0 through 7.0.15\n- FortiSwitchManager 7.2.0 through 7.2.3\n- FortiSwitchManager 7.0.0 through 7.0.3\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended updating vulnerable products as soon as possible.\n\n## Workaround\n\nTo mitigate the vulnerability **CVE-2025-25256**, it is possible to limit access to the `phMonitor` port (7900) of FortiSIEM.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-25-152>\n\n[2] <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-24-042>\n\n[3] <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-25-448>",
