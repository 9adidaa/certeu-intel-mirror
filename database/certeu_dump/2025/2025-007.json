It is strongly recommended to update vulnerable Kibana instances.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-25012** arises from prototype pollution in Kibana, leading to arbitrary code execution via a crafted file upload and specifically crafted HTTP request [1].\n\n# Products Affected\n\nIn Kibana versions >= 8.15.0 and < 8.17.1, the vulnerability is exploitable by users with the Viewer role. In Kibana versions 8.17.1 and 8.17.2, this is only exploitable by users that have roles that contain all the following privileges: `fleet-all`, `integrations-all`, `actions:execute-advanced-connectors` [1].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating to Kibana version 8.17.3 as soon as possible.\n\n# Mitigations\n\nFor users who cannot upgrade immediately, Elastic advises to set the `xpack.integration_assistant.enabled` configuration option to `false` in Kibana's configuration (`kibana.yml`) [1].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://discuss.elastic.co/t/kibana-8-17-3-security-update-esa-2025-06/375441>\n\n",
