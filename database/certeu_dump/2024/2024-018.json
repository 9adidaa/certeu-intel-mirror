It is recommended updating as soon as possible.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2024-21762** [1], with a CVSS score of 9.8, is due to incorrect parameter checks in FortiOS SSL-VPN. When exploited by a remote and unauthenticated attacker via crafted HTTP requests, a reduced number of bytes could be copied outside buffer bounds, leading to memory corruption and flow redirection. This allows execution of arbitrary code or command.\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2024-23113** [2], with a CVSS score of 9.8, is due to an externally controlled format string vulnerability in FortiOS fgfmd daemon, and may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands via specially crafted requests.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe following product versions are affected:\n\n- FortiOS version 7.4.0 through 7.4.2;\n- FortiOS version 7.2.0 through 7.2.6;\n- FortiOS version 7.0.0 through 7.0.13; \n- FortiOS version 6.4.0 through 6.4.14;\n- FortiOS version 6.2.0 through 6.2.15;\n- FortiOS 6.0 all versions (only affected by CVE-2024-21762).\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating or upgrading to a non-vulnerable version of the product as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-24-015>\n\n[2] <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-24-029>\n",
