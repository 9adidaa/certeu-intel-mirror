Microsoft has added the relevant certificates to its revocation list as part of the usual Patch Tuesday cycle.\n\nThe second vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2024-29988,** is described as a SmartScreen prompt security feature bypass vulnerability caused by a protection mechanism failure weakness [2]. This vulnerability is related to `CVE-2024-21412`, which was discovered by ZDI threat researchers and first addressed in February. The first patch did not completely resolve the vulnerability. This update addresses the second part of the exploit chain. \n\n# Affected Products\n\nAffected products include, but are not limited to, Microsoft Windows, Azure, Office, Windows Defender, SQL Server, DNS Server [3].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended applying updates as soon as possible on affected assets.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-april-2024-patch-tuesday-fixes-150-security-flaws-67-rces/>\n\n[2] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-fixes-two-windows-zero-days-exploited-in-malware-attacks/>\n\n[3] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2024-Apr>\n",
