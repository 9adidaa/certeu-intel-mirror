These vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary file write to Windows system root directory, access to potentially restricted data and remote code execution [1,2].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2024-45733**, with a CVSS score of 8.8, could allow a low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin” or “power” Splunk roles to perform a Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to an insecure session storage configuration.\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2024-45731**, with a CVSS score of 8.0, could allow a low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin” or “power” Splunk roles to write a file to the Windows system root directory, which has a default location in the Windows `System32` folder, when Splunk Enterprise for Windows is installed on a separate drive. The user could potentially write a malicious DLL which, if loaded, could result in a remote execution of the code within that DLL.\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2024-45732**, with a CVSS score of 7.1, could allow a low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin” or “power” Splunk roles to run a search as the “nobody” Splunk user in the SplunkDeploymentServerConfig app. This could let the low-privileged user access potentially restricted data.\n\nPlease refer to https://advisory.splunk.com/ for the complete list of vulnerabilities.\n\n# Affected Products\n\n- The vulnerability **CVE-2024-45733** affects the Splunk Web component of Splunk Enterprise for Windows versions 9.2.0 to 9.2.2, and 9.1.0 to 9.1.5.\n- The vulnerability **CVE-2024-45731** affects the Splunk Web component of Splunk Enterprise for Windows versions 9.3.0, 9.2.0 to 9.2.2, and 9.1.0 to 9.1.5 if the Splunk Enterprise instance is installed on a separate disk.\n- The vulnerability **CVE-2024-45732** affects the SplunkDeploymentServerConfig component Splunk for Cloud Platform, and Splunk Enterprise versions 9.2.0 to 9.2.2, and 9.3.0.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended updating affected assets as soon as possible, prioritising Internet facing devices.\n\nIt is also recommended:\n\n- disabling the Splunk Web component on indexers in distributed environments;\n- restricting write access to knowledge objects within Splunk apps by modifying the local.meta file in the `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkDeploymentServerConfig/metadata` directory as follows:\n\n```\n    []\n    access = read : [ * ], write : [ admin ]\n```\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://advisory.splunk.com/>\n\n[2] <https://cybersecuritynews.com/splunk-vulnerabilities-remote-code/>",
