  "description": "On January 4th, 2024, a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability was fixed in Ivanti's Endpoint Management software (EPM). This vulnerability, tracked as \"CVE-2023-39336\" (CVSS score : 9.6), allows unauthenticated attackers to hijack enrolled devices or the core server. Ivanti EPM is used to manage client devices across various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, and IoT operating systems. The vulnerability affects all supported versions of Ivanti EPM and has been resolved in version 2022 Service Update 5. The editor also states that no evidence of active exploitation was currently found.<br>\n",
