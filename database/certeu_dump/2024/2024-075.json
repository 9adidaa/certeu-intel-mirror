The flaw allows attackers with kernel-level access to gain Ring-2 privileges, potentially installing undetectable malware by modifying System Management Mode (SMM) settings [1].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe SinkClose vulnerability (CVSS score: 7.5) enables privilege escalation to Ring-2, allowing attackers to modify SMM settings even with SMM Lock enabled. This can disable security features and facilitate persistent, nearly undetectable malware.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nAccording to AMD's advisory, the following models are affected [1]:\n\n- EPYC 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generations\n- EPYC Embedded 3000, 7002, 7003, and 9003, R1000, R2000, 5000, and 7000\n- Ryzen Embedded V1000, V2000, and V3000\n- Ryzen 3000, 5000, 4000, 7000, and 8000 series\n- Ryzen 3000 Mobile, 5000 Mobile, 4000 Mobile, and 7000 Mobile series\n- Ryzen Threadripper 3000 and 7000 series\n- AMD Threadripper PRO (Castle Peak WS SP3, Chagall WS)\n- AMD Athlon 3000 series Mobile (Dali, Pollock)\n- AMD Instinct MI300A\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends applying AMD’s available mitigations immediately [2].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-amd-sinkclose-flaw-helps-install-nearly-undetectable-malware/>\n\n[2] <https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7014.html>",
