This vulnerability allows attackers to forge SAML responses, granting unauthorised administrative access without authentication. [1]\n\nA proof of concept is publicly available. CERT-EU strongly recommends updating as soon as possible. [2]\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability `CVE-2024-4985`, with a CVSS score of 10, involves SAML SSO with the optional encrypted assertions feature. An attacker could forge a SAML claim that contains correct user information. When GHES processes a fake SAML claim, it will not be able to validate its signature correctly, allowing an attacker to gain access to the GHES instance.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe following GitHub Enterprise Server versions are affected:\n\n- 3.12.0 to 3.12.3;\n- 3.11.0 to 3.11.9;\n- 3.10.0 to 3.10.11;\n- 3.9.0 to 3.9.14.\n\nOnly instances using SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication are affected.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends updating as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-warns-of-saml-auth-bypass-flaw-in-enterprise-server/>\n\n[2] <https://github.com/absholi7ly/Bypass-authentication-GitHub-Enterprise-Server>\n",
