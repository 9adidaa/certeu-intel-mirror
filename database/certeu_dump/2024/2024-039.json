This vulnerability stems from a bias in ECDSA nonce generation when using the NIST P-521 elliptic curve. Attackers can exploit this bias to recover private keys after observing a relatively small number of ECDSA signatures.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nPuTTY, when utilising the NIST P-521 elliptic curve, generates ECDSA nonces with the first 9 bits set to zero. This significant bias makes it feasible for attackers to employ state-of-the-art lattice-based techniques to recover the complete private key from these biased nonces after collecting around 60 valid ECDSA signatures.\n\n# Affected Products\n\n- PuTTY versions before 0.81\n- FileZilla versions from 3.24.1 to 3.66.5\n- WinSCP versions from 5.9.5 to 6.3.2\n- TortoiseGit versions from 2.4.0.2 to 2.15.0\n- TortoiseSVN versions from 1.10.0 to 1.14.6\n\n# Recommendations\n\nUsers are urged to update their software to a fixed version immediately to mitigate the vulnerability. It is also recommended reviewing and replacing any NIST P-521 (`521-bit ECDSA`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`) keys that may have been used with affected versions of PuTTY, as these keys should be considered compromised.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-p521-bias.html>\n",
