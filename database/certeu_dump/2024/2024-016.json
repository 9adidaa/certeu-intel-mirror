This vulnerability, tracked as `CVE-2024-21626` with a CVSS score of 8.6, enables attackers to escape containers and potentially gain unauthorised access to the host operating system.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability `CVE-2024-21626` arises from an internal file descriptor leak within runc, a core component for running containers according to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards.\n\nThe vulnerability manifests through the improper handling of file descriptors and the `WORKDIR` directive in Dockerfiles, allowing a container process to maintain access to privileged host directory file descriptors. \n\nAttackers can exploit this by manipulating the container's working directory to point to these file descriptors, gaining the ability to read from or write to the host filesystem.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThis vulnerability impacts systems running runc version 1.1.11 and earlier. Due to runc's widespread use in container runtimes like Docker and Kubernetes, a significant number of containerised environments may be vulnerable.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends upgrading to runc version 1.1.12, which includes patches for this issue. Additionally, technologies that incorporate runc should be updated to their latest patched versions. Following vendor advisories and applying updates for container hosting services and infrastructure is also advised.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://snyk.io/fr/blog/cve-2024-21626-runc-process-cwd-container-breakout/>\n\n[2] <https://threatprotect.qualys.com/2024/02/02/docker-patches-multiple-vulnerabilities-impacting-runc-buildkit-and-moby-leaky-vessels/>\n\n[3] <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2024-21626)>\n",
