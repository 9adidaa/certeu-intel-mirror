This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands via crafted HTTP requests, posing a significant risk to exposed services [1,2].\n\nImmediate updates are recommended for all affected installations.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2024-45410** has a CVSS score of 9.8 out of 10. It allows remote code execution due to improper validation of input.\n\nThe vulnerability arises from Traefik's handling of HTTP headers which are added during request processing. It was found that certain custom headers could be removed or manipulated due to HTTP/1.1 behaviour allowing hop-by-hop headers via the Connection header. There are no known workarounds [1,2].\n\n# Affected Products\n\n- Traefik versions prior to **2.11.9** and **3.1.3** [3,4]\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends updating as soon as possible to mitigate the risk of exploitation. \n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://github.com/traefik/traefik/security/advisories/GHSA-62c8-mh53-4cqv>\n\n[2] <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45410>\n\n[3] <https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v3.1.3>\n\n[4] <https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.11.9>",
