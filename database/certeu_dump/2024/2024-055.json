CERT-EU strongly recommends patching them as soon as possible. \n\n# Technical Details\n\n**CVE-2024-28995** - SolarWinds Serv-U was susceptible to a directory transversal vulnerability that would allow access to read sensitive files on the host machine [2]. \n\n**CVE-2024-28996** - The SolarWinds Platform was determined to be affected by a SWQL Injection Vulnerability. Attack complexity is high for this vulnerability [3].\n\n**CVE-2024-28999** - The SolarWinds Platform was determined to be affected by a Race Condition Vulnerability affecting the web console [4].\n\n**CVE-2024-29004** - The SolarWinds Platform was determined to be affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability affecting the web console. High-privileged user credentials are needed, and user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability [5].\n\n# Affected Products\n\n- SolarWinds Serv-U 15.4.2 HF 1 and previous versions (CVE-2024-28995)\n- SolarWinds Platform 2024.1 SR 1 and previous versions (CVE-2024-28996, CVE-2024-28999, and CVE-2024-29004)\n\n# Recommendations\n\nSolarWinds has released updated versions of their products where these vulnerabilities are patched. CERT-EU strongly recommends updating the relevant products as soon as possible. \n\n## References\n\n[1] <https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories>\n\n[2] <https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2024-28995>\n\n[3] <https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2024-28996>\n\n[4] <https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2024-28999>\n\n[5] <https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2024-29004>\n\n\n",
