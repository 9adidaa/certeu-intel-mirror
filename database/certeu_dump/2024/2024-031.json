Six (6) high severity vulnerabilities with a CVSS score of 8.6, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause denial of service on an affected device [1].\n\n# Technical details\n\n- `CVE-2024-20311`, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LISP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition [2].\n- `CVE-2024-20314`, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain IPv4 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust CPU resources and stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS condition [3].\n- `CVE-2024-20307` and `CVE-2024-20308`, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition [4].\n- `CVE-2024-20259`, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCP request through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition [5].\n- `CVE-2024-20271`, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 packet either to or through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker does not need to be associated with the affected AP. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by sending IPv6 packets [6].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe complete list of affected products can be found on the vendor's website [1].\n\nCisco has released workarounds for the vulnerabilities `CVE-2024-20307` and `CVE-2024-20308` [4].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating to the latest version of the affected product as soon as possible to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x>\n\n[2] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-lisp-3gYXs3qP>\n\n[3] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-xe-sda-edge-dos-qZWuWXWG>\n\n[4] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ikev1-NO2ccFWz>\n\n[5] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dhcp-dos-T3CXPO9z>\n\n[6] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ap-dos-h9TGGX6W>\n",
