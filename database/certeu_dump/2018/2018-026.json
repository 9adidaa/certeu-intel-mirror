According to the Center for Internet Security [1], these vulnerabilities allow an adversary to perform an arbitrary code execution and/or denial-of-service attack (DoS).\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerabilities affect the system in accordance with the associated privileges of the application. The adversary successfully exploiting the vulnerabilities can install programs, view, change or delete data and modify/create users even with admin privileges. A failed exploitation can potentially lead to a state of denial of service [1].\n\n# Versions Affected\n\n- PHP 7.2 prior to 7.2.11 [2]\n- PHP 7.1 prior to 7.1.23 [3]\n\n# Recommendations\n\n1. Check if the system has unauthorized modifications -- in case these vulnerabilities have already been exploited.\n2. Upgrade to the latest version (either 7.1.23 or 7.2.11)\n3. Apply the _Least Privilege_ principle to the system and services to limit the impact in case a PHP application is exploited.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.cisecurity.org/advisory/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-php-could-allow-for-arbitrary-code-execution_2018-113/>\n\n[2] <http://php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.2.11>\n\n[3] <http://php.net/ChangeLog-7.php#7.1.23>\n",
