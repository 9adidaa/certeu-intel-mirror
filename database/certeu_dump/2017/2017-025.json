  "description": "On the 20th of November 2017, Intel reported that it has identified security vulnerabilities that could impact Intel Management Engine, Intel Trusted Execution Engine, and Intel Server Platform Services. As the result, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to platforms by impersonating the Intel Engines and platforms. An attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause system crash. The attacks can be conducted even when a computer is powered off.",
