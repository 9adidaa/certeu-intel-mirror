The most serious of the vulnerabilities could allow remote arbitrary code execution in a virtual machine.\n\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerabilities received four CVEs: CVE-2017-4941, CVE-2017-4933, CVE-2017-4940, and CVE-2017-4943.\n\nThe first vulnerability (CVE-2017-4941) can be exploited by a remote attacker to execute code in a virtual machine via an authenticated Virtual Network Computing (VNC) session. According to Cisco Talos _A specially crafted set of VNC packets can cause a type confusion resulting in stack overwrite, which could lead to code execution_ [2]. ESXi, Workstation and Fusion are affected [1].\n\nThe second vulnerability (CVE-2017-4933) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in a virtual machine using specially crafted VNC packets. In that case _A specially crafted set of VNC packets can cause a heap overflow resulting in heap corruption_ [3]. ESXi, Workstation and Fusion are affected [1].\n\nThe third vulnerability (CVE-2017-4940) allows for persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in ESXi Host Client. It could be exploited by injecting Javascript code that gets executed by other users [1].\n\nLast vulnerability is (CVE-2017-4943) is a privilege escalation affecting VMware vCenter Server Appliance `showlog` plugin. It can be exploited by an attacker with low privileges to gain root level access [1].\n\n# Products Affected\n\nSeveral versions and components of VMware ESXi, vCenter Server Appliance, Workstation and Fusion are affected [1].\n\n# Recommendations\n\n* Review the patch level for your product and version and update accordingly [1].\n* As a workaround for CVE-2017-4941 and CVE-2017-4933 vulnerabilities: Exploitation can be blocked by disabling VNC in `.vmx` configuration of VMS and blocking the traffic on firewall.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2017-0021.html>\n\n[2] <https://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2017-0369>\n\n[3] <https://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2017-0368>\n",
