An attacker could exploit those flaws to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution on the vulnerable device. One of these vulnerabilities have been exploited in a limited number of cases [1].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2026-1281**, with a CVSS score of 9.8, is a code injection vulnerability in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile.\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2026-1340**, with a CVSS score of 9.8, is a code injection vulnerability in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe following versions of Ivanti's Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) are affected:\n\n- 12.5.1.0 and prior.\n- 12.6.1.0 and prior.\n- 12.7.0.0 and prior.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends securing forensic evidence to detect any signs of exploitation. CERT-EU also recommends following the vendor's guidance to apply the hotfix (i.e. RPM 12.x.0 or RPM 12.x.1) on vulnerable appliances. As noted by the vendor, the applied RPM script will not survive a version upgrade which means that the script will need to be reapplied after an upgrade to a new version. The permanent fix for this vulnerability will be included in the release 12.8.0.0 which is planned for Q1 2026.\n\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Advisory-Ivanti-Endpoint-Manager-Mobile-EPMM-CVE-2026-1281-CVE-2026-1340?language=en_US>",
