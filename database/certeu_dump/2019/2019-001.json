However, already published research describes practical examples of this type of attack [1]. Also, recently there have been documented cases of observing exploitation of these types of vulnerabilities on production systems.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nCaching improves web-page load times by reducing latency while also reducing the load on application server. It can be implemented at different levels: specific software, offered by content delivery networks (CDN), or built-in into web applications and frameworks. All of these are susceptible to cache poisoning.\n\nWeb cache poisoning is a specific type of a more generic family of cache poisoning vulnerabilities [2]. The impact of a maliciously constructed response from a webserver can be magnified if it is cached and served to multiple users.  The published research [1] presents practical ways of cache poisoning by using **unkeyed inputs**. Unkeyed inputs are parts of a request that a cache does not use for _mapping_ the caches.\n\n# Products Affected\n\nCache servers and services, web applications and frameworks.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n- Disable caching, if possible from operational point of view. In some cases caching is enabled by default – not necessarily needed for performance reasons.\n- If disabling the cache is not possible, restrict caching to purely static responses.\n- Audit every URL of an application with `Param Miner` to detect and disable unkeyed inputs. `Param Miner` is a `Burp Suite` extension used to detect unkeyed inputs [3].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://portswigger.net/blog/practical-web-cache-poisoning>\n\n[2] <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cache_Poisoning>\n\n[3] <https://github.com/PortSwigger/param-miner>\n",
