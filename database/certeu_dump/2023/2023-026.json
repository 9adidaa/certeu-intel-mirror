The vulnerability is tracked as `CVE-2023-20126` and has a CVSS score of 9.8 [1].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapters could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a missing authentication process within the firmware upgrade function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by upgrading an affected device to a crafted version of firmware. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with full privileges [1].\n\nThere are currently no reports yet of an active exploitation of this vulnerability [2].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThis vulnerability affects all firmware releases for Cisco SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapters [1].\n\nMoreover, Cisco has not released and will not release firmware updates to address the vulnerability, because Cisco SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapters have entered the end of-life process and are no longer supported [1].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU encourage constituents to discontinue using the product, as well as verify if any other similar -- possibly also no longer supported -- products are in use. \n\n# Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. \n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-spa-unauth-upgrade-UqhyTWW>\n\n[2] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-phone-adapters-vulnerable-to-rce-attacks-no-fix-available/>",
