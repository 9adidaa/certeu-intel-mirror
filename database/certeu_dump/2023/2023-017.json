These vulnerabilities are identified by CVE-2023-27898 and CVE-2023-27905 and could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's Jenkins server, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the Jenkins server. Furthermore, these vulnerabilities could be exploited even if the Jenkins server is not directly reachable by attackers and could also impact self-hosted Jenkins servers.",

These vulnerabilities are identified by `CVE-2023-27898` and `CVE-2023-27905` and could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's Jenkins server, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the Jenkins server.\n\nFurthermore, these vulnerabilities could be exploited even if the Jenkins server is not directly reachable by attackers and could also impact self-hosted Jenkins servers [2].  \n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe issue is a result of a flaw in the Jenkins' processing of available plugins from the Update Center, thereby potentially enabling a threat actor to upload a plugin with a malicious payload and trigger a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Once the victim opens the 'Available Plugin Manager' on their Jenkins server, the XSS is triggered, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code on the Jenkins Server utilising the Script Console API [2].\n\nSince it's also a case of stored XSS wherein the JavaScript code is injected into the server, the vulnerability can be activated without having to install the plugin or even visit the URL to the plugin in the first place.\n\n# Affected Products\n\n- Jenkins weekly up to and including 2.393;\n- Jenkins LTS up to and including 2.375.3;\n- update-center2 up to and including 3.14.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating Jenkins servers to the latest available version:\n\n- Jenkins weekly should be updated to version 2.394;\n- Jenkins LTS should be updated to version 2.375.4 or 2.387.1;\n- update-center2 should be updated to version 3.15.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2023-03-08/>\n\n[2] <https://blog.aquasec.com/jenkins-server-vulnerabilities>\n",
