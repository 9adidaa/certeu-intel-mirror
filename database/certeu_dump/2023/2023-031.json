This issue was discovered in GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE) version 16.0.0, with older versions not being affected. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary files on the server when an attachment exists in a public project nested within at least five groups [1,2].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe critical path traversal flaw was discovered by a security researcher known as _pwnie_. The flaw arises from a problem in the way GitLab manages or resolves paths for attached files nested within several levels of group hierarchy. It can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, thereby potentially exposing sensitive data, including proprietary software code, user credentials, tokens, files, and other private information. \n\nThe vulnerability can only be triggered under specific conditions, i.e., when there's an attachment in a public project nested within at least five groups [1,2].\n\n# Products Affected\n\nThe issue affects GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE) version 16.0.0.\n\nThe older versions are not affected by this vulnerability. \n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends that all installations running GitLab CE/EE version 16.0.0 be upgraded to version 16.0.1.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2023/05/23/critical-security-release-gitlab-16-0-1-released/>\n\n[2] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gitlab-strongly-recommends-patching-max-severity-flaw-asap/>\n",
