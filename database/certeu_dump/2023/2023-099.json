These vulnerabilities, if exploited, could lead to Remote Code Execution or Denial of Service [1,2].

The vulnerabilities include: `CVE-2023-41727`, `CVE-2023-46216`, `CVE-2023-46217`, `CVE-2023-46220`, `CVE-2023-46221`, `CVE-2023-46222`, `CVE-2023-46223`, `CVE-2023-46224`, `CVE-2023-46225`, `CVE-2023-46257`, `CVE-2023-46258`, `CVE-2023-46259`, `CVE-2023-46260`, and `CVE-2023-46261`.\n\n- The vulnerability `CVE-2023-46260`, with a CVSS score of 7.5, is caused by a Null Pointer Dereference that, if exploited, could lead to a Denial of Service condition.\n\n- The vulnerability `CVE-2023-46262`, with a CVSS score of 7.5, could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker sending a specifically crafted web request causing a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Ivanti Avalanche Remote Control server.\n\n- The vulnerability `CVE-2023-46266`, with a CVSS score of 7.3, could be exploited by an attacker sending a specially crafted request which could lead to leakage of sensitive data or potentially a resource-based DoS attack.\n\n- The vulnerabilities `CVE-2023-46263` and `CVE-2023-46264`, with a CVSS score of 7.2, could allow an attacker to upload of files with dangerous type in Avalanche and to achieve a remove code execution.\n\n- The vulnerabilities `CVE-2023-46803` and `CVE-2023-46804`, with a CVSS score of 7.5, could be exploited by an attacker sending specially crafted data packets to the Mobile Device Server to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n- The vulnerability `CVE-2023-46265`, with a CVSS score of 6.5, could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker to leak data or perform a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) on the Smart Device Server.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThese vulnerabilities affect at least Ivanti Avalanche versions 6.4.1 and 6.4.2.
