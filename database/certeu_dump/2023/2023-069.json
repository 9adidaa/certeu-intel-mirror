These vulnerabilities are affecting iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices and are currently being used in the wild for spyware installation purposes [1].\n\n**Updates as of 06/10/2023** Apple released another emergency update to patch a new zero-day flaw tracked as `CVE-2023-42824` and reported to be exploited against version of iOS before 16.6. This update also fixes `CVE-2023-5217`, a buffer overflow in `libpvx` that may result in arbitrary code execution.  \n\nUpdating is recommended as soon as possible.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerabilities `CVE-2023-41993` and `CVE-2023-41991` were found respectively in the WebKit browser engine and the Security framework. They could allow attackers to bypass signature validation using malicious apps or gain arbitrary code execution via maliciously crafted web pages.\n\nRegarding the vulnerability `CVE-2023-41992`, it was found in the Kernel Framework, which provides APIs and support for kernel extensions and kernel-resident device drivers. Local attackers can exploit this flaw to escalate privileges.  \n\n**Updates as of 06/10/2023** `CVE-2023-42824` is related to a weakness in the XNU kernel and can be exploited to escalate privileges as well.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe list of impacted devices encompasses older and newer device models, and it includes:\n\n- iPhone 8 and later;\n- iPad mini 5th generation and later;\n- Macs running macOS Monterey and newer;\n- Apple Watch Series 4 and later.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nThis issue is fixed in iOS 16.7 and iPadOS 16.7, iOS 17.0.1 and iPadOS 17.0.1, watchOS 9.6.3, macOS Ventura 13.6, watchOS 10.0.1. Any other version can be considered as vulnerable.  \n\n**Updates as on 06/10/2023**  Both `CVE-2023-42824` and `CVE-2023-5217` are fixed in iOS 17.0.3 and iPadOS 17.0.3.  \n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends that all devices running a version affected by the issues described above are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions/>\n\n[2] <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213926>\n\n[3] <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213931>\n\n[4] <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213961>\n",
