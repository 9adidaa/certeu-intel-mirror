These vulnerabilities pose significant risks and require immediate attention [1].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nAmong the vulnerabilities, the five disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities are:\n\n- `CVE-2023-36025` - CVSS score **8.8**: A weakness that allows malicious content to bypass the Windows SmartScreen Security feature. SmartScreen is a built-in Windows component that tries to detect and block malicious websites and files. Microsoft’s security advisory for this flaw says attackers could exploit it by getting a Windows user to click on a booby-trapped link to a shortcut file.\n- `CVE-2023-36033` - CVSS score **7.8** : Microsoft has fixed an actively exploited and publicly disclosed Windows DWM Core Library vulnerability that can be used to elevate privileges to `SYSTEM`.\n- `CVE-2023-36036` - CVSS score **7.8** : Microsoft has fixed an actively exploited and publicly disclosed Windows DWM Core Library vulnerability that can be used to elevate privileges to `SYSTEM`.\n- `CVE-2023-36038` - CVSS score **8.2** : ASP.NET Core Denial of Service. An attacker that could successfully exploit this vulnerability could trigger an `OutOfMemoryException`, resulting in a DoS condition.\n- `CVE-2023-36413` - CVSS score **6.5** : Microsoft Office Security Feature Bypass. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using social engineering tactics to convince a target to open a malicious Microsoft Office file on a vulnerable system. Successful exploitation would result in a bypass of security features of Microsoft Office designed to protect users including Protected View and the file would be opened in editing mode instead of protected mode.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nFor the zero-day vulnerabilities, the affected products are:\n\n- Microsoft Windows;\n- ASP.NET;\n- Microsoft Office.\n\nSpecific product and version details are available on Microsoft's security update guide [2]. This is also valid for the other vulnerabilities.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends immediate application of Microsoft's November patches [1].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/alert-microsoft-releases-patch-updates.html>\n\n[2] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2023-Nov>\n\n",
