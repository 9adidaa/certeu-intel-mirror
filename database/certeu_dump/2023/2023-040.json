The affected software provides a centralised and extensible platform for managing virtual infrastructure [1,2]. The vulnerabilities were found in the DCERPC protocol implementation utilised by vCenter Server. The protocol allows for smooth operation across multiple systems by creating a virtual unified computing environment [3].\n\n# Technical Details\n\n- `CVE-2023-20892` (CVSSv3 base score of 8.1) - a heap overflow vulnerability due to the usage of uninitialised memory in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. A malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.\n\n- `CVE-2023-20893` (CVSSv3 base score of 8.1) - a use-after-free vulnerability in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. A malicious actor with network access to v…ut-of-bounds write vulnerability in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. A malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server may trigger an out-of-bound write by sending a specially crafted packet leading to memory corruption.\n\n- `CVE-2023-20895` (CVSSv3 base score of 8.1) - a memory corruption vulnerability in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol. A malicious actor with network access to vCenter Server may trigger a memory corruption vulnerability which may bypass authentication.\n\n# Affected Products\n\n- vCenter Server 7.0 [1]\n- vCenter Server 8.0 [1]\n- Cloud Foundation (vCenter Server) 4.x [1]\n- Cloud Foundation (vCenter Server) 5.x [1]\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU highly recommends installing the fixed versions as soon as possible:\n\n- vCenter Server 7.0 U3m [1]\n- vCenter Server 8.0 U1b [1]\n- Cloud Foundation (vCenter Server) 7.0 U3m [1]\n- Cloud Foundation (vCenter Server) 8.0 U1b [1]\n\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2023-0014.html>\n\n[2] <https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/products/vCenter/vmware-vcenter-server-datasheet.pdf>\n\n[3] <https://vulnera.com/newswire/vmware-addresses-high-severity-security-flaws-in-vcenter-server/>\n\n",
