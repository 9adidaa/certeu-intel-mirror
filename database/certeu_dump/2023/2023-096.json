The vulnerable class includes a function that is executed automatically after PHP has processed a request, and which uses properties that an attacker may have full control of [2].\n\nIt can be combined with a different object injection flaw, allowing attackers to execute PHP code on vulnerable websites. While WordPress Core currently does not have any known object injection vulnerabilities, the WordPress security team feels that there is potential for high severity when combined with some plugins, especially in multi-site installations.\n\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThis vulnerability affects WordPress version 6.4 until 6.4.2 (excluded).\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is strongly recommended manually checking WordPress sites to ensure that it is updated, and if not, It is strongly recommended updating it.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://wordpress.org/documentation/wordpress-version/version-6-4-2/>\n\n[2] <https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2023/12/psa-critical-pop-chain-allowing-remote-code-execution-patched-in-wordpress-6-4-2/>\n\n[3] <https://www.securityweek.com/wordpress-6-4-2-patches-remote-code-execution-vulnerability/>",
