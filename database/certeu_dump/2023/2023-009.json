Therefore, for those customers who disable automatic updates in the Microsoft Store, Microsoft will not be pushing out the update automatically.\n\n## CVE-2023-21715 -  Microsoft Publisher Security Features Bypass Vulnerability [3]\n\nThis vulnerability, with a CVSS score of 7.3, affects Microsoft Publisher and allows a specially crafted document to bypass Office macro policies that block untrusted or malicious files. Exploiting this flaw would effectively allow macros in a malicious Publisher document to run without first warning the user.\n\nThe attack itself is carried out locally by a user with authentication to the targeted system.\n\n## CVE-2023-23376 -  Windows Common Log File System Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability [4]\n\nThis vulnerability, with a CVSS score of 7.8, affects Windows Common Log File System Driver. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain SYSTEM privileges.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nGlobal list of affected products by all the vulnerabilities are listed in the original advisory from Microsoft [1].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nMicrosoft and CERT-EU strongly recommend installing security updates as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-february-2023-patch-tuesday-fixes-3-exploited-zero-days-77-flaws/>\n\n[2] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-21823>\n\n[3] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-21715>\n\n[4] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-23376>\n\n[5] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/microsoft-patch-tuesday-reports/February-2023.html>\n",
