Ivanti has released security patches [2] addressing this vulnerability.\n\n# Technical Details\n\n**CVE-2023-35081** enables an authenticated administrator to perform arbitrary file writes to the EPMM server. This vulnerability can be used in conjunction with **CVE-2023-35078** [3], bypassing administrator authentication and ACLs restrictions (if applicable).\n\nSuccessful exploitation can be used to write malicious files to the appliance, ultimately allowing a malicious actor to execute OS commands on the appliance as the tomcat user.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nIvanti reports the vulnerability impacts all supported versions of Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) – Version 11.4 releases 11.10, 11.9 and 11.8.\n\nNote that **older versions/releases are also at risk**.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends reviewing Ivanti's security advisory [2] and upgrading affected systems to avoid potential exploitation of this vulnerability.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/threat-advisory-remote-file-write-vulnerability-in-ivanti-epmm/>\n\n[2] <https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/KB-Arbitrary-File-Write-CVE-2023-35081?language=en_US>\n\n[3] <https://www.cert.europa.eu/static/security-advisories/CERT-EU-SA2023-053.pdf>",
