This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. Microsoft expects this vulnerability likely to be exploited soon.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the HTTP/3 protocol stack of current Microsoft Windows systems. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability if the attacked system fulfils some prerequisites:\n\n* HTTP/3 needs to be active, and\n* the server uses buffered I/O.\n\nIf the system fulfils these prerequisites, an attacker can send a specially crafted packet to the system and trigger the vulnerability.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nMicrosoft Windows Server 2022, Microsoft Windows 11 (21H2,22H2).\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends applying the latest patches for Microsoft Windows Server 2022, focusing on Internet-facing systems first. Additionally, CERT-EU recommends applying the latest patches to systems running Microsoft Windows 11.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nHTTP/3 support for services is a new feature in recent Windows operating systems. A prerequisite for a server to be vulnerable is that the binding has HTTP/3 enabled, and the server uses buffered I/O. Therefore, disabling HTTP/3 via a registry key mitigates this vulnerability [2].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2023-23392>\n\n[2] <https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/networking-blog/enabling-http-3-support-on-windows-server-2022/ba-p/2676880>",
