The flaws were responsibly reported to the vendor and as of the time of writing, there is no evidence of exploitation in the wild.\n\nCERT-EU urges users to promptly apply the provided fixes [2]. \n\n# Technical Details\n\n## Critical Vulnerability (CVE-2023-34039)\n\nAria Operations for Networks contains an Authentication Bypass vulnerability due to a lack of unique cryptographic key generation. This vulnerability may allow an attacker with network access to Aria Operations for Networks, to bypass SSH authentication and gain unauthorised access to the Aria Operations for Networks command-line interface (CLI).\n\n## High-Severity Vulnerability (CVE-2023-20898)\n\nAria Operations for Networks contains an arbitrary file write vulnerability. An authenticated malicious actor with administrative access to VMware Aria Operations for Networks could exploit this vulnerability to write files to arbitrary locations, potentially resulting in remote code execution.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe versions of the product starting with **6.2** and prior to **6.11** are impacted.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nThe vulnerabilities are fixed in versions **6.11** [2].\n\n## Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround available for these vulnerabilities.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2023-0018.html>\n\n[2] <https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/94152>\n",
