External attackers may exploit this vulnerability in publicly accessible Confluence Data Center and Server instances to create unauthorised Confluence administrator accounts and access Confluence instances. Atlassian Cloud sites are **not affected** by this vulnerability.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nExternal attackers can exploit a vulnerability in publicly accessible Confluence Data Center and Server instances. This allows them to create unauthorized Confluence administrator accounts and access the said instances. The vulnerability seems to impact the `/setup/*.action` and `/server-info.action` endpoints but no further technical details are provided yet. \n\n\n# Affected Products\n\n**Confluence Data Center and Server versions:**\n\n- 8.0.0 to 8.0.4\n- 8.1.0 to 8.1.4\n- 8.2.0 to 8.2.3\n- 8.3.0 to 8.3.2\n- 8.4.0 to 8.4.2\n- 8.5.0 to 8.5.1\n\nNote: Versions prior to 8.0.0 are **not affected**.\n\n# Detections\n\nEven after an updating Confluence to a fixed version, ensure you check all affected Confluence instances for:\n\n1. Unexpected members of the `confluence-administrators` group.\n2. Newly created user accounts that were not expected.\n3. Requests to `/setup/*.action` in network access logs.\n4. Presence of `/setup/setupadministrator.action` in an exception message in the Confluence home directory (`atlassian-confluence-security.log`) \n5. Presence of `/server-info.action` in network access logs, as mentionned by Rapid7 [2].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended to upgrade to one of the following fixed versions (or any later version):\n\n- 8.3.3 or later\n- 8.4.3 or later\n- 8.5.2 (Long Term Support release) or later\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, you should:\n\n1. Restrict external network access to the affected instance.\n2. Block access to the `/setup/*` endpoints. This can be done at the network layer or by modifying configuration files as described:\n\n    - On each node, modify `/<confluence-install-dir>/confluence/WEB-INF/web.xml` to include:\n\n    ```xml\n    <security-constraint>\n          <web-resource-collection>\n            <url-pattern>/setup/*</url-pattern>\n    \t\t\t<http-method-omission>*</http-method-omission>\n    \t\t</web-resource-collection>\n          <auth-constraint />\n    \t</security-constraint>\n    ```\n\n    - Restart Confluence.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22515-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-server-1295682276.html>\n\n[2] <https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/10/04/etr-cve-2023-22515-zero-day-privilege-escalation-in-confluence-server-and-data-center/>",
