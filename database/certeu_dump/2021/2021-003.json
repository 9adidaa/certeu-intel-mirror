These vulnerabilities could lead to **remote code execution**, **denial of service**, or **authtication bypass**. While Cisco is not aware of any malicious exploit in the wild, it is highly recommended to patch the affected products.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThis advisory only describes the most critical vulnerabilities disclosed by Cisco.\n\n## CVE-2021-1300\n\nThe first vulnerability, identified by **CVE-2021-1300**, is due to incorrect handling of IP traffic by the SD-WAN software. By sending crafted packets to a vulnerable device, an **unauthenticated, remote** attacker could cause a **buffer overflow** on the underlying software. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability could lead the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the operating system with **root** privileges. The CVSS score of this vulnerability is **9.8**\n\n## CVE-2021-1302\n\nThe second vulnerability, identified by **CVE-2021-1302**, is due to insufficient authorization checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the **unauthenticated** attacker to bypass authorization and connect to other vManage tenants that they are not authorized to connect to. The CVSS score of this vulnerability is **8.8**\n\n## CVE-2021-1299\n\nThe third vulnerability, identified by **CVE-2021-1299**, is due to improper input validation of user-supplied input to the device template configuration. An **authenticated** attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the device template configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root-level access to the affected system. The CVSS score of this vulnerability is **9.9**\n\n## CVE-2021-1241\n\nThe forth vulnerability, identified by **CVE-2021-1241**, is due to insufficient handling of malformed packets. An **unauthenticated** attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reboot, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected system. The CVSS score of this vulnerability is **8.6**\n\n## CVE-2021-1273\n\nThe fifth vulnerability, identified by **CVE-2021-1273**, is due to the bounds checking in the forwarding plane of the IPSec tunnel management functionality. An **unauthenticated, remote** attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packets to a specific device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected system. The CVSS score of this vulnerability is **8.6**\n\n## CVE-2021-1274\n\nThe sixth vulnerability, identified by **CVE-2021-1274**, is due to the presence of a null dereference in vDaemon. An **unauthenticated, remote** attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to a specific device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected system. The CVSS score of this vulnerability is **8.6**\n\n# Affected products\n\nThe following products could be affected by the vulnerabilities:\n\n* IOS XE SD-WAN Software\n* SD-WAN vBond Orchestrator Software\n* SD-WAN vEdge Cloud Routers\n* SD-WAN vEdge Routers\n* SD-WAN vManage Software\n* SD-WAN vSmart Controller Software\n\nThe following software releases are affected by the vulnerabilities:\n\n* SD-WAN Software\n\t* release versions prior to 20.3\n\t* release version 20.3 prior to 20.3.2\n\t* release version 20.4 prior to 20.4.1\n* IOS XE SD-WAN Software\n\t* release versions prior to 16.12\n\t* release version 16.12 prior to 16.12.4\n* IOS XE Software\n\t* release version 17.2 prior to 17.2.2\n\t* release version 17.3 prior to 17.3.1\n\t* release version 17.4 prior to 17.4.1\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended to apply the patches from Cisco for all affected software and products.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-bufovulns-B5NrSHbj>\n\n[2] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-abyp-TnGFHrS>\n\n[3] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-cmdinjm-9QMSmgcn>\n\n[4] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-dosmulti-48jJuEUP>\n\n[4] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-dosmulti-48jJuEUP>\n",
