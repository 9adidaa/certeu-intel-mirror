An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to take control of an affected device [2]. One vulnerability is known to be used to install the Pegasus spyware on iPhones [3] and Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited [1].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nBoth vulnerabilities allow maliciously crafted documents to execute commands when opened on vulnerable devices.\n\n## CVE-2021-30860 - CoreGraphics\n\nThe CVE-2021-30860 CoreGraphics vulnerability is an integer overflow bug discovered by Citizen Lab that allows threat actors to create malicious PDF documents that execute commands when opened in iOS and macOS [3]. The exploit, which called `FORCEDENTRY`, targets Apple’s image rendering library, and was effective against Apple iOS, MacOS and WatchOS devices [4].\n\n## CVE-2021-30858 - WebKit\n\nThe CVE-2021-30858 is a WebKit use after free vulnerability allowing hackers to create maliciously crafted web page that execute commands when visiting them on iPhones and macOS. Apple states that this vulnerability was disclosed anonymously [3].\n\n# Products Affected\n\nThe vulnerabilities affect:\n\n- iPhones with iOS versions prior to 14.8;\n- Mac computers with operating system versions prior to OSX Big Sur 11.6 and Catalina Security Update 2021-005;\n- Apple Watches prior to watchOS 7.6.2;\n- Safari with versions prior to 14.1.2.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nApple has released software updates addressing the vulnerabilities [1].\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating vulnerable software as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222>\n\n[2] <https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/09/13/apple-releases-security-updates-address-cve-2021-30858-and-cve>\n\n[3] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/apple/apple-fixes-ios-zero-day-used-to-deploy-nso-iphone-spyware/>\n\n[4] <https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/>\n",
