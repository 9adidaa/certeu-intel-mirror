An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could do privilege escalation and run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges [1].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nVulnerability dubbed _HiveNightmare_ and _SeriousSAM_ has also received CVE-2021-36934. By incorrectly setting Access Control List `BUILTIN\\Users` group is given RX permissions to files in the `%windir%\\system32\\config` directory.\n\nIf a VSS shadow copy of the system drive is available, a non-privileged user may leverage access to these files to achieve a number of impacts, including but not limited to:\n\n- Extract and leverage account password hashes.\n- Discover the original Windows installation password.\n- Obtain DPAPI computer keys, which can be used to decrypt all computer private keys.\n- Obtain a computer machine account, which can be used in a silver ticket attack\n\n# Affected Products\n\nWindows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2019 and  Windows Server Coreve versions. For more specific type and version please check [1].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nThere is no patch for CVE-2021-36934 as of July 21, 2021. It is recommened to apply the workaround available.\n\n## Workaround\n\n### Restrict Access to the Contents of `%windir%\\system32\\config`\n\n* Command Prompt (Run as administrator): `icacls %windir%\\system32\\config\\*.* /inheritance:e`\n* Windows PowerShell (Run as administrator): `icacls $env:windir\\system32\\config\\*.* /inheritance:e`\n\n### Delete Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) Shadow Copies\n\n1. Delete any System Restore points and Shadow volumes that existed prior to restricting access to `%windir%\\system32\\config`.\n2. Create a new System Restore point (if desired).\n\nImpact of deleting shadow copies could impact restore operations, including the ability to restore data with third-party backup applications. For more information on how to delete shadow copies, see [4].\n\nNote: You must restrict access and delete shadow copies to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability [1].\n\n# Exploitation\n\nExploits are already available for this flaw [3].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-36934>\n\n[2] <https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/07/21/microsoft-sam-file-readability-cve-2021-36934-what-you-need-to-know/>\n\n[3] <https://github.com/GossiTheDog/HiveNightmare>\n\n[4] <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5005357-delete-volume-shadow-copies-1ceaa637-aaa3-4b58-a48b-baf72a2fa9e7>\n",
