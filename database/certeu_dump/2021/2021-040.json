The vulnerability is dubbed _Sequoia_ [1].\n\n# Technical Details\n\n`fs/seq_file.c` file in the affected Linux kernels does not properly restrict seqential buffer allocations, leading to an integer overflow, an out-of-bounds write, and escalation to root by an unprivileged user. Virtual file system implementation in the Linux kernel contained an unsigned to signed integer conversion error. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nLinux distros using kernel 3.16 through 5.13.x before 5.13.4\n\n# Recommendations\n\nFollow the instructions from the specific distro to update. For the most common you can reffer to [2, 3, 4].\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating the vulnerable systems as soon as possible.\n\n## Workaround\n\nQualys, who discoverd this bug, has created an exploit as a PoC as well as mitigations to prevent their specific exploit from working [1]. Other exploitation techniques may exist. To completely fix this vulnerability, the kernel must be patched.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2021/07/20/sequoia-a-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-linuxs-filesystem-layer-cve-2021-33909>\n\n[2] <https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-33909>\n\n[3] <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33909>\n\n[4] <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-33909>\n",
