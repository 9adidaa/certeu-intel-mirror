The attacker needs access to the management interface to use the exploit.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nInformation extracted from F5 advisories [1]:\n\n## **CVE-2021-22986**: iControl REST unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability (K03009991)\n\nThe iControl REST interface has an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability.\n\nCVSS score: 9.8 (Critical)\n\n## **CVE-2021-22987**: Appliance Mode TMUI authenticated remote command execution vulnerability (K18132488)\n\nWhen running in Appliance mode, the Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI), also referred to as the Configuration utility, has an authenticated remote command execution vulnerability in undisclosed pages.\n\nCVSS score: 9.9 (Critical)\n\n## **CVE-2021-22988**: TMUI authenticated remote command execution vulnerability (K70031188)\n\nTMUI, also referred to as the Configuration utility, has an authenticated remote command execution vulnerability in undisclosed pages.\n\nCVSS score: 8.8 (High)\n\n## **CVE-2021-22989**: Appliance mode Advanced WAF/ASM TMUI authenticated remote command execution vulnerability (K56142644)\n\nWhen running in Appliance mode with Advanced WAF or BIG-IP ASM provisioned, the TMUI, also referred to as the Configuration utility, has an authenticated remote command execution vulnerability in undisclosed pages.\n\nCVSS score: 8.0 (High)\n\n## **CVE-2021-22990**: Advanced WAF/ASM TMUI authenticated remote command execution vulnerability (K45056101)\n\nOn systems with Advanced WAF or BIG-IP ASM provisioned, the TMUI, also referred to as the Configuration utility, has an authenticated remote command execution vulnerability in undisclosed pages.\n\nCVSS score: 6.6 (Medium)\n\n## **CVE-2021-22991**: TMM buffer-overflow vulnerability (K56715231)\n\nUndisclosed requests to a virtual server may be incorrectly handled by the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) URI normalization, which may trigger a buffer overflow, resulting in a DoS attack. In certain situations, it may theoretically allow bypass of URL based access control or remote code execution (RCE).\n\nCVSS score: 9.0 (Critical)\n\n## **CVE-2021-22992**: Advanced WAF/ASM buffer-overflow vulnerability (K52510511)\n\nA malicious HTTP response to an Advanced WAF/BIG-IP ASM virtual server with Login Page configured in its policy may trigger a buffer overflow, resulting in a DoS attack. In certain situations, it may allow remote code execution (RCE), leading to complete system compromise.\n\nCVSS score: 9.0 (Critical)\n\n# Affected Products\n\n* BIG-IP before 16.0.1.1, 15.1.2.1, 14.1.4, 13.1.3.6, 12.1.5.3, and 11.6.5.3\n* CVE-2021-22986 also affects BIG-IQ before 8.0.0, 7.1.0.3, and 7.0.0.2\n\nDepending on the deployment mode, some vulnerabilities may not apply. To get more detail, please consult the table available on F5 advisory [1].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nApply the patches as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K02566623>\n\n[2] <https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K03009991>\n\n[3] <https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K56715231>\n\n[4] <https://attackerkb.com/topics/J6pWeg5saG/k03009991-icontrol-rest-unauthenticated-remote-command-execution-vulnerability-cve-2021-22986>\n",
