A remote code execution vulnerability classified as **Important** affects Windows SMBv3 Client/Server.\n\nThe vulnerability tracked as CVE-2022-24508 is a remote code execution vulnerability allowing an authenticated user to execute malicious code on Windows 10 version 2004 and newer systems via SMBv3 [2]. No active exploitation of this vulnerability is known yet.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThere is not much detail available about how this vulnerability could be exploited. However, it is notable because it is listed as _Exploitation more likely_ by Microsoft. This vulnerability is rated **Important** rather than **Critical**. There is no public disclosure, and it is not currently being exploited. However, the attack vector and likelihood of exploitation make it a candidate for possible attacks, and so this should be a high priority for patching [3].\n\n# Affected Products\n\n* Windows 10 Version 21H1 for 32-bit Systems\n* Windows 10 Version 21H1 for ARM64-based Systems\n* Windows 10 Version 21H1 for x64-based Systems\n* Windows 10 Version 20H2 for 32-bit Systems\n* Windows 10 Version 20H2 for x64-based Systems\n* Windows Server 2022 Azure Edition Core Hotpatch\n* Windows Server 2022 (Server Core installation)\n* Windows Server 2022\n* Windows 10 Version 21H2 for x64-based Systems\n* Windows 10 Version 21H2 for ARM64-based Systems\n* Windows 10 Version 21H2 for 32-bit Systems\n* Windows 11 for ARM64-based Systems\n* Windows 11 for x64-based Systems\n* Windows Server, version 20H2 (Server Core Installation)\n* Windows 10 Version 20H2 for ARM64-based Systems\n\n# Mitigations\n\nMicrosoft strongly recommends to install the updates but also provide workaround steps by disabling SMBv3 compression [4]. \n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends to apply the patches released on March 2022 Patch Tuesday [5].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-march-2022-patch-tuesday-fixes-71-flaws-3-zero-days/>\n\n[2] <https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/09/microsoft_patch_tuesday/>\n\n[3] <https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/03/08/microsoft-patches-71-vulnerabilities-including-rdp-client-exchange-server-intune/>\n\n[4] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-24508>\n\n[5] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2022-Mar>\n",
