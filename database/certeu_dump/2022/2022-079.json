The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to elevation of privilege, security feature bypass, remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service and spoofing [2].\n\nIt is highly recommended applying the fixes as soon as possible.\n\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThis month's Patch Tuesday fixes six actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities (publicly disclosed or actively exploited with no official fix available), with one being publicly disclosed:\n\n* `CVE-2022-41128` is a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the JScript9 Scripting Language. This could be exploited by convincing a user to visit a specially crafted server share or website (usually using phishing techniques).\n\n* `CVE-2022-41091` is a Security Feature Bypassing vulnerability. An attacker could craft a malicious file that will evade Mark of the Web (MOTW) defences resulting in a limited loss of integrity and availability of security features such as Protected View in Microsoft Office, which rely on MOTW tagging [3].\n\n* `CVE-2022-41073` is an Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to gain **SYSTEM** privileges by exploiting a flaw in the Windows Print Spooler.\n\n* `CVE-2022-41125` is an Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability, which could allow an attacker to gain **SYSTEM** privileges by exploiting a flaw in the Windows CNG Key Isolation Service.\n\n* `CVE-2022-41040` is an Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server (`ProxyNotShell`), that could allow an attacker to run PowerShell in the context of the **SYSTEM**.\n\n* `CVE-2022-41082` is a Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server (`ProxyNotShell`). As an authenticated user, the attacker could attempt to trigger malicious code in the context of the server's account through a network call.\n\n\n# Affected Products\n\n* Microsoft Windows Server from version 2008 R2, to version 2022 are affected.\n* Microsoft Windows Desktop from version Windows 7, to version Windows 11 are affected.\n* Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 23 is affected [4]\n* Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Cumulative Updates 22 and 23 are affected [4]\n* Microsoft Exchange Server 2019 Cumulative Updates 11 and 12 are affected [4]\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends applying the available fixes as soon as possible. \n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/microsoft-patch-tuesday-reports/November-2022.html>\n\n[2] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-november-2022-patch-tuesday-fixes-6-exploited-zero-days-68-flaws/>\n\n[3] <https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1544416883419619333>\n\n[4] <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/description-of-the-security-update-for-microsoft-exchange-server-2019-2016-and-2013-november-8-2022-kb5019758-2b3b039b-68b9-4f35-9064-6b286f495b1d>",
