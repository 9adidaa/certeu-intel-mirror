The vulnerabilities identified as `CVE-2022-22954`, `CVE-2022-22955`, `CVE-2022-22956`, `CVE-2022-22957`, and `CVE-2022-22958` can lead to multiple effects such as remote code execution and authentication bypass.\n\nVMware also patched high and medium severity bugs that could be exploited for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks (`CVE-2022-22959`), privilege escalation (`CVE-2022-22960`), and gain access to information without authorisation (`CVE-2022-22961`) [1].\n\nOn May 20th, Unit 42 has observed numerous instances of `CVE-2022-22954` being exploited in the wild [4]. When successful, `CVE-2022-22960` can be leveraged to run commands as a root user. It is strongly recommended to patch as soon as possible [2].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nHere are the technical details of the vulnerabilities :\n\n- `CVE-2022-22954` - CVSS score: 9.8 - VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager contain a remote code execution vulnerability due to server-side template injection.\n\n- `CVE-2022-22955` and `CVE-2022-22956` - CVSS score: 9.8 - VMware Workspace ONE Access has two authentication bypass vulnerabilities in the OAuth2 ACS framework.\n\n- `CVE-2022-22957` and `CVE-2022-22958` - CVSS score: 9.1 - VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager and vRealize Automation contain two remote code execution vulnerabilities. \n\n- `CVE-2022-22959` - CVSS score: 8.8 - VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager and vRealize Automation contain a cross site request forgery vulnerability.\n\n- `CVE-2022-22960` - CVSS score: 7.8 - VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager and vRealize Automation contain a privilege escalation vulnerability due to improper permissions in support scripts. \n\n- `CVE-2022-22961` - CVSS score: 5.3 - VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager and vRealize Automation contain an information disclosure vulnerability due to returning excess information.\n\n# Affected Products\n\n- VMware Workspace ONE Access (Access)\n- VMware Identity Manager (vIDM)\n- VMware vRealize Automation (vRA)\n- VMware Cloud Foundation\n- vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager\n\n# Recommendations and Workarounds\n\nCERT-EU recommends to apply the patches or the workarounds provided by VMware [2]. While applying workarounds is possible, VMware strongly recommends patching as the simplest and most reliable way to resolve this issue.\n\nVMware has also published a document with additional questions and answers regarding VMSA-2021-0011 [3].\n\nSince vulnerabilities `CVE-2022-22954` and `CVE-2022-22960` are exploited in the wild [4], it is highly recommended to apply the patches as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vmware-warns-of-critical-vulnerabilities-in-multiple-products/>\n\n[2] <https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0011.html>\n\n[3] <https://core.vmware.com/vmsa-2022-0011-questions-answers-faq>\n\n[4] <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2022-22954-vmware-vulnerabilities/>\n",
