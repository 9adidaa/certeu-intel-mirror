It can be exploited remotely by an attacker using a specialy crafted certificate that can trigger an infinite loop. LibreSSL was also impacted by this vulnerability and it has been also patched [2].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe `BN_mod_sqrt()` function used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form, contains a bug that can cause the modular square root compute to loop forever for non-prime moduli.\n\nSince certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThis issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.0, 1.1.1 and 3.0.  \n\nRespectivelly, it also affects LibreSSL prior to 3.3.6, 3.4.3, and 3.5.1.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n- OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2zd (premium support customers only)\n- OpenSSL 1.1.1 users should upgrade to 1.1.1n\n- OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to 3.0.2\n\nOpenSSL 1.1.0 is out of support and no longer receiving updates of any kind. Its users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0 or 1.1.1.\n\nRegarding LibreSSL, the patched versions are 3.3.6, 3.4.3, and 3.5.1.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20220315.txt>\n\n[2] <https://lwn.net/Articles/887972/>\n",
