An attacker can cause the application to load data from incorrect endpoints, URLs leading to outcomes such as running arbitrary SPL queries [3].\n\nA vulnerability was found in Splunk Enterprise up to 8.1.1 and it has been declared as **critical** and named **CVE-2022-26889** [1].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThis vulnerability affects processing of the component Search Parameter Handler. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a privilege escalation vulnerability. The exploitation appears to be easy. The attack can be initiated remotely. No authentication is required for a successful exploitation. Neither more technical details, nor an exploit is yet publicly available [2]. \n\n# Affected products\n\nSplunk Enterprise versions before 8.1.2. The vulnerability does not impact Splunk Cloud Platform instances [4].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends to upgrade Splunk Enterprise to 8.1.2 or later. \n\n# Workarounds\n\nThe vulnerability impacts instances with Splunkweb enabled [1]. More information on disabling Splunkweb can be found in Securing Splunk Enterprise [5] and Splunk Enterprise administration manuals [6].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/product-security/announcements/svd-2022-0506.html>\n\n[2] <https://vuldb.com/?id.199240>\n\n[3] <https://research.splunk.com/application/path_traversal_spl_injection/>\n\n[4] <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26889>\n\n[5] <https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents?_gl=1*dumf7s*_ga*NDYxOTU3ODcyLjE2NTMwNjAzNTE.*_gid*MTUyMjI1ODMzNi4xNjUzMDYwMzUy&_ga=2.98395231.1522258336.1653060352-461957872.1653060351>\n\n[6] <https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Webconf?_gl=1*oiaygj*_ga*NDYxOTU3ODcyLjE2NTMwNjAzNTE.*_gid*MTUyMjI1ODMzNi4xNjUzMDYwMzUy&_ga=2.24651898.1522258336.1653060352-461957872.1653060351>\n",
