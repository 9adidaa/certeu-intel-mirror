Five of them are rated **critical** with **CVSS Score 9.8**. In particular, critical vulnerabilities affect: telnet service of firewall routers (CVE-2020-3330), web-based management interface of routers (CVE-2020-3323, CVE-2020-3144, and CVE-2020-3331), and web management interface of Cisco Prime License Manager (PLM) software (CVE-2020-3140) [1].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nWe present here on the details of the critical vulnerabilities. Additional information may be found in [1].\n\n**CVE-2020-3330**\n\nThe vulnerability exists because a system account has a default and static password. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this default account to connect to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain full control of an affected device [2].\n\n**CVE-2020-3323**\n\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system of the affected device [3].\n\n**CVE-2020-3144**\n\nThe vulnerability is due to improper session management on affected devices. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrative access on the affected device [4].\n\n**CVE-2020-3331**\n\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input data by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `root` user [5].\n\n**CVE-2020-3140**\n\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input on the web management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious request to an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrative-level privileges on the system. The attacker needs a valid username to exploit this vulnerability [6].  \n\n# Products Affected\n\nThese vulnerabilities affect several products:\n\n* RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall (CVE-2020-3323, CVE-2020-3144), and releases earlier than Release 1.2.2.8 (CVE-2020-3331)\n* RV130 VPN Router (CVE-2020-3330, CVE-2020-3323, CVE-2020-3144)\n* RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router (CVE-2020-3330, CVE-2020-3323, CVE-2020-3144)\n* RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router (CVE-2020-3330, CVE-2020-3323, CVE-2020-3144), and releases earlier than Release 1.3.1.7. (CVE-2020-3331)\n* Cisco Prime License Manager 10.5(2)SU9 and earlier (CVE-2020-3140)\n* Cisco Prime License Manager 11.5(1)SU6 and earlier (CVE-2020-3140)\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. **CERT-EU strongly advises applying available patches [1] as soon as possible**.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n* For vulnerabilities identified by CVE-2020-3330, CVE-2020-3140, and CVE-2020-3331 there are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\n* For vulnerabilities identified by CVE-2020-3144 and CVE-2020-3323, there are also no workarounds. However, disabling the remote management feature (if it is not required) would help to reduce the attack surface.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x>\n\n[2] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv110w-static-cred-BMTWBWTy>\n\n[3] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-rce-AQKREqp>\n\n[4] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-auth-bypass-cGv9EruZ>\n\n[5] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-code-exec-wH3BNFb>\n\n[6] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cisco-prime-priv-esc-HyhwdzBA>\n",
