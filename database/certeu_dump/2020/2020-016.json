Trend Micro confirmed that they identified active attempts against the zero-day vulnerabilities, but without disclosing more details.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to update, especially because exploits are available and there were attack attempts. Even if the zero-days require user authentication, they could be used in a post-compromise scenario to either disable the security products or elevate the attackers' privileges on machines running the two Trend Micro antivirus products [2].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability CVE-2020-8467 with **critical severity** (CVSSv3 score of 9.1) is due to a migration tool component of Trend Micro Apex One and OfficeScan that contains a vulnerability which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations (RCE). An attempted attack requires user authentication.\n\nThe vulnerability CVE-2020-8468 with **high severity** (CVSSv3 score of 8.0) is due to the Trend Micro Apex One and OfficeScan agents that are affected by a content validation escape vulnerability which could allow an attacker to manipulate certain agent client components. An attempted attack requires user authentication.\n\nThe vulnerability CVE-2020-8470 with **critical severity** (CVSSv3 score of 10) is due to the Trend Micro Apex One and OfficeScan server which contains a vulnerable service DLL file that could allow an attacker to delete any file on the server with SYSTEM level privileges. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability CVE-2020-8598 with **critical severity** (CVSSv3 score of 10) is due to the Trend Micro Apex One and OfficeScan server which contains a vulnerable service DLL file that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on affected installations with SYSTEM level privileges. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability CVE-2020-8599 with **critical severity** (CVSSv3 score of 10) is due to the Trend Micro Apex One and OfficeScan server which contain a vulnerable EXE file that could allow a remote attacker to write arbitrary data to an arbitrary path on affected installations and bypass ROOT login. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n# Products Affected\n\nProducts affected by the critical and high severity vulnerabilities:\n\n* Apex One (on premise) version\t2019 Platform: Windows\n* OfficeScan versions XG SP1 and XG (non-SP) Platform: Windows\n\n# Recommendations\n\nUpdate Trend Micro products to the latest versions:\n\n* Apex One (on premise) CP 2117\n* OfficeScan XG SP1 CP 5474\n* OfficeScan XG CP 1988\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/000245571>\n\n[2] <https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-trend-micro-zero-days-exploited-in-the-wild-by-hackers/>\n",
