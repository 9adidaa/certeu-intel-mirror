This vulnerability may allow **unauthenticated attackers** with network access via HTTP to achieve **total compromise and takeover** of vulnerable Oracle WebLogic Servers [2]. This bug has been assigned **CVE-2020-14882** and has a **CVSS score of 9.8** and is now being reported as being **exploited in the wild** [3].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe bug involves different weaknesses in the way the server handles user-supplied requests. An attacker could send a simple HTTP GET request to exploit the vulnerability, execute code and get full control on the server [4].\n\nTo address this vulnerability, a patch has been released by Oracle in October 2020. **This vulnerability is now reported to be under active exploitation** [5].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe vulnerability exists in Oracle WebLogic Server, versions [1]:\n\n- 10.3.6.0.0,\n- 12.1.3.0.0,\n- 12.2.1.3.0,\n- 12.2.1.4.0,\n- 14.1.1.0.0.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended to apply the necessary patches from the October Oracle Critical Patch Update [1] as soon as possible and to look for any indicator of compromised on your network, beginning with firewall logs.\n\n## Detection of Exploitation\n\nThe following strings in GET requests could be an indication of successful exploitation [5]:\n\n- `/console/images/%252E%252E%252Fconsole.portal`\n- `/console/css/%252E%252E%252Fconsole.portal`\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html>\n\n[2] <https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/10/29/cve-2020-14882/>\n\n[3] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-oracle-weblogic-flaw-actively-targeted-in-attacks/>\n\n[4] <https://testbnull.medium.com/weblogic-rce-by-only-one-get-request-cve-2020-14882-analysis-6e4b09981dbf>\n\n[5] <https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/26734>\n",
