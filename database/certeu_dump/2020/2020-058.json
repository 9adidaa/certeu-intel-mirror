It could allow an authenticated local attacker to cause a targeted AnyConnect user to execute a malicious script.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability was assigned *CVE-2020-3556* with a CVSS score of 7.3 [1].\n\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication to the IPC listener. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPC messages to the AnyConnect client IPC listener. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the targeted AnyConnect user to execute a script. This script would execute with the privileges of the targeted AnyConnect user.\n\n# Products Affected\n\nThis vulnerability affects all versions of the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Software for the following platforms if they have a vulnerable configuration:\n\n* AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows\n* AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for MacOS\n* AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Linux\n\nThis vulnerability does not affect Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for the Apple iOS and Android platforms.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCisco will release free software updates that will address the vulnerability described in this advisory.\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Clients once an update is available.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nThe recommended workaround is to upgrade to *Release 4.9.04053* and edit the `AnyConnectLocalPolicy.xml` file to set `RestrictScriptWebDeploy` to **true**. Ensure that `BypassDownloader` is set to **false**. The new `AnyConnectLocalPolicy.xml` file would then be deployed to end machines using an out-of-band method of deployment.\n\nThere are additional configuration settings for Release 4.9.04053 and later that are strongly recommended to be set for increased protection [2].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-ipc-KfQO9QhK/>\n\n[2] <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyconnect49/release/notes/release-notes-anyconnect-4-9.html#Cisco_Reference.dita_79c2fd57-db64-4449-9072-26e62e46630b>\n",
