This could result in loss of intellectual property, damaging data leaks, supply chain attacks, and other high-risk scenarios [2].\n\nIt is strongly recommended updating as soon as possible to a fixed version.\n\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability `CVE-2023-4998` has a CVSS score of 9.6 out of 10, and is a bypass of the fix for the medium severity flaw identified as `CVE-2023-3932` [3]. By using scheduled security scan policies, it is possible for an authenticated attacker to run pipelines as an arbitrary user. Pipeline tasks are series of automated tasks that could give access to sensitive information, allow users to run code, modify data or trigger specific events.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe flaw impacts GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE) versions 13.12 through 16.2.7 and versions 16.3 through 16.3.4.\n\nInstances running versions earlier than 16.2 are vulnerable if both _Direct transfers_ [4] and _Security policies_ [5] features are enabled at the same time.\n \n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends that all installations running a version affected by the issues described above are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible.\n\n## Workaround\n\nFor instances running versions earlier than 16.2, in order to mitigate this vulnerability in situations where it is not possible to upgrade, it is required to disable the _Direct transfers_ feature and/or the _Security policies_ feature.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2023/09/18/security-release-gitlab-16-3-4-released/>\n\n[2] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gitlab-urges-users-to-install-security-updates-for-critical-pipeline-flaw/>\n\n[3] <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3932>\n\n[4] <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/import_and_export_settings.html#enable-migration-of-groups-and-projects-by-direct-transfer>\n\n[5] <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/scan-execution-policies.html>\n\n",
