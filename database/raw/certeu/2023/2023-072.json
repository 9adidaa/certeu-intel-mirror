This vulnerability can be exploited to obtain full root privileges, impacting several major Linux distributions.\n\nIt is recommended updating as soon as possible.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe GNU C Library's dynamic loader is responsible for locating and loading shared libraries needed by a program. It operates with elevated privileges when executing a set-user-ID program, set-group-ID program, or a program with capabilities. \n\nThe vulnerability `CVE-2023-4911` specifically relates to the processing of the `GLIBC_TUNABLES` environment variable. It was introduced in glibc 2.34 in April 2021 by the commit `2ed18c`. When ld.so starts its execution, it invokes `__tunables_init()` to search for `GLIBC_TUNABLES`  variables. Upon finding any, it makes a copy and proceeds to sanitise this copy. However, due to incorrect handling, a buffer overflow can be triggered and leveraged to obtain full root privileges.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe following distributions before the patch and in their default installation were successfully exploited by Qualys' team:\n\n- Fedora 37 and 38\n- Ubuntu 22.04 and 23.04\n- Debian 12 and 13\n\nOther distributions might be vulnerable except for Alpine Linux which utilises musl libc instead of glibc.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nUsers and administrators are urged to apply patches as soon as they are available from their respective distribution's repository.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.qualys.com/2023/10/03/cve-2023-4911/looney-tunables-local-privilege-escalation-glibc-ld-so.txt>\n\n[2] <https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5514>",
