This flaw poses risks such as user impersonation, unauthorised data access, modification, deletion and service disruption. \n\nThe other four vulnerabilities are less severe:\n\n* `CVE-2023-20253` (CVSS 8.4): Unauthorised configuration rollback due to CLI vulnerabilities.\n* `CVE-2023-20034` (CVSS 7.5): Information disclosure vulnerability in ElasticSearch access control.\n* `CVE-2023-20254` (CVSS 7.2): Authorisation bypass in the session management system. (requires multi-tenant feature enabled).\n* `CVE-2023-20262` (CVSS 5.3): DoS vulnerability in the SSH service. (affects SSH access only).\n\nNotably, `CVE-2023-20034` is remotely exploitable without authentication, but access is limited to the `Elasticsearch` database with the privileges of the `Elasticsearch` user.\n\n# Affected Products\n\n|Release|CVE-2023-20252 Critical SIR|CVE-2023-20253 High SIR|CVE-2023-20034 High SIR|CVE-2023-20254 High SIR| CVE-2023-20262 Medium SIR|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Earlier than 20.3|\tNot affected.|Migrate to a fixed release.|Migrate to a fixed release.|Migrate to a fixed release.|Migrate to a fixed release.|\n|20.3|\tNot affected.|Migrate to a fixed release.|20.3.4|Migrate to a fixed release.|20.3.7|\n|20.4|\tNot affected.|Migrate to a fixed release.|Migrate to a fixed release.|Migrate to a fixed release.|Migrate to a fixed release.|\n|20.5|\tNot affected.|Migrate to a fixed release.|Migrate to a fixed release.|Migrate to a fixed release.|Migrate to a fixed release.|\n|20.6|\tNot affected.|20.6.2|20.6.1|20.6.3.4|Migrate to a fixed release.|\n|20.7|\tNot affected.|20.7.1|20.7.1|Migrate to a fixed release.|Migrate to a fixed release.|\n|20.8|\tNot affected.|20.8.1|Not affected.|\tMigrate to a fixed release.|Migrate to a fixed release.|\n|20.9|20.9.3.4[^1]|\t20.9.1|Not affected.|20.9.3.2|20.9.3|\n|20.10|\tNot affected.|20.10.1|Not affected.|20.10.1.2|Migrate to a fixed release.|\n|20.11|\tMigrate to a fixed release.|20.11.1|Not affected.|20.11.1.2|20.11.1|\n|20.12|\tNot affected.|Not affected.|Not affected.|Not affected.|20.12.1|\n\n[^1]: For `CVE-2023-20252`, only releases 20.9.3.2 and 20.11.1.2 are affected.
