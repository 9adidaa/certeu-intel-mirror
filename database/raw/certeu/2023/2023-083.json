[1]\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe **CVE-2023-46747** vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the BIG-IP system through the management port and/or self IP addresses to execute arbitrary system commands. The vulnerability resides in the Configuration utility component of the affected versions.\n\n# Affected products\n\nAll models of BIG-IP are affected.\n\n|Versions known to be vulnerable| Fixes introduced in|\n|-|-|\n|17.1.0|17.1.0.3 + Hotfix-BIGIP-17.1.0.3.0.75.4-ENG|\n|16.1.0 - 16.1.4|16.1.4.1 + Hotfix-BIGIP-16.1.4.1.0.50.5-ENG|\n|15.1.0 - 15.1.10| 15.1.10.2 + Hotfix-BIGIP-15.1.10.2.0.44.2-ENG|\n|14.1.0 - 14.1.5| 14.1.5.6 + Hotfix-BIGIP-14.1.5.6.0.10.6-ENG|\n|13.1.0 - 13.1.5|13.1.5.1 + Hotfix-BIGIP-13.1.5.1.0.20.2-ENG|\n\n_Software versions that have reached the End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not listed._\n\n# Mitigations \n\nF5 has provided a shell script specifically tailored for mitigating the identified issue on affected products version 14.1.0 and later.

[1]\n\n_It is important not to run the script on software versions below 14.1.0._\n\n# Workarounds\n\nSince the vulnerable component is the Configuration utility of the product, F5 has provided two temporary workarounds [1] which are:\n\n- to block Configuration utility access through self IP addresses;\n- to block Configuration utility access through the management interface.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends taking one of the following actions as a priority:\n\n1. Update to the latest version of the affected software.\n2. Apply the provided mitigation and workarounds when updating is not possible immediately.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000137353>\n",
