Google is aware that an exploit for this vulnerability exists in the wild.\n\nIt is recommended updating as soon as possible.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability `CVE-2023-7024` is caused by a heap buffer overflow in the WebRTC component. The flaw was reported by Clément Lecigne and Vlad Stolyarov of Google’s Threat Analysis Group on 2023-12-19 and fixed in just one day. The fact that the issue was discovered by Google TAG suggests it was exploited by a nation-state actor or by a surveillance firm [2]. Google has not shared further details about the vulnerability, stating that:\n\n>Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThis vulnerability affects Google Chrome versions below 120.0.6099.129 for Mac, Linux, and versions below 120.0.6099.129/130 for Windows.\n\n**[UPDATE]** This vulnerability also affects Chromium-based web browser such as Microsoft Edge [3], Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended updating as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/12/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_20.html>\n\n[2] <https://securityaffairs.com/156231/security/google-addressed-a-new-actively-exploited-chrome-zero-day.html>\n\n[3] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-7024>",
