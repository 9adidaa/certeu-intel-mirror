Citrix NetScaler Gateway consolidates remote access infrastructure to provide single sign-on across all applications whether in a data center, in a cloud, or if the apps are delivered as SaaS apps. It allows people to access any app, from any device, through a single URL [3].\n\n# Technical Details\n\n`CVE-2023-3519` (CVSS score of 9.8): Unauthenticated remote code execution. **Exploits of CVE-2023-3519 on unmitigated appliances have been observed!** In order to exploit the vulnerability the appliance must be configured as a Gateway (VPN virtual server, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy) or AAA virtual server [1].\n\n`CVE-2023-3466` (CVSS score of 8.3): Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability can be exploited if a victim access an attacker-controlled link in the browser while being on a network with connectivity to the appliance [1].\n\n`CVE-2023-3467` (CVSS score of 8.0): Privilege Escalation to root administrator (`nsroot`). Authenticated access to NSIP or SNIP with management interface access is required in order to leverage this flaw [1].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe following supported versions of NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway are affected by the vulnerabilities [1]: \n\n- NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.1 before 13.1-49.13 \n- NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-91.13 \n- NetScaler ADC 13.1-FIPS before 13.1-37.159\n- NetScaler ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.297\n- NetScaler ADC 12.1-NDcPP before 12.1-55.297\n\nNote: NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 12.1 is now End Of Life (EOL) and is vulnerable [1].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU highly recommends installing the latest updated versions as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX561482/citrix-adc-and-citrix-gateway-security-bulletin-for-cve20233519-cve20233466-cve20233467>\n\n[2] <https://www.netscaler.com/articles/what-is-an-application-delivery-controller>\n\n[3] <https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-gateway.html>\n",
