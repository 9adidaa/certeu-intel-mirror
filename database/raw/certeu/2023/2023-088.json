The attacker must obtain additional information, such as by monitoring TLS traffic, to identify the user they would want to impersonate. \n\n`CVE-2023-39337`, with a CVSS score of 6.8, this vulnerability enables an authenticated user (enrolled device) to obtain a valid certificate for another EPMM user. Like the previous vulnerability, the attacker must obtain additional information, such as by monitoring TLS traffic, to identify the user they would want to impersonate.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThese vulnerabilities impact all supported versions of the products – EPMM Versions 11.10, 11.9 and 11.8 and Sentry Versions 9.18. 9.17 and 9.16. Older versions/releases are also at risk. \n\n# Recommendations\n\nFor both vulnerabilities, Ivanti released a patch included in the following EPMM (Core) releases. 11.10.0.4, 11.11.0.2, 11.12.0.0.\n\nCERT-EU recommends immediately applying updates provided by Ivanti to vulnerable systems. \n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.ivanti.com/blog/ivanti-epmm-cve-2023-39335-39337>\n\n[2] <https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/CVE-2023-39337?language=en_US>\n\n[3] <https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/CVE-2023-39335?language=en_US>\n",
