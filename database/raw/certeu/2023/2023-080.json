The most severe vulnerabilities are tracked as **CVE-2023-35182** and **CVE-2023-35184** for Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, as well as **CVE-2023-35185** and **CVE-2023-35187** for Directory Traversal Remote Code Vulnerability, with a CVSS score of 8.8 out of 10. [1]\n\nIt is recommended updating as soon as possible.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nVarious vulnerabilities were addressed in this patch release, including:\n\n- **CVE-2023-35180**: This vulnerability (CVSS score of 8.0) allows authenticated users to abuse SolarWinds ARM API in order to remotely execute code. [1]\n- **CVE-2023-35181**: This vulnerability (CVSS score of 7.8) allows users to abuse incorrect folder permission resulting in privilege escalation. [1]\n- **CVE-2023-35182**: This vulnerability (CVSS score of 8.8) can be abused by unauthenticated users on SolarWinds ARM Server resulting in remote code execution. [1]\n- **CVE-2023-35183**: This vulnerability (CVSS score of 7.8) allows authenticated users to abuse local resources resulting in privilege escalation. [1]\n- **CVE-2023-35184**: This vulnerability (CVSS score of 8.8) allows an unauthenticated user to abuse a SolarWinds service resulting in a remote code execution. [1]\n- **CVE-2023-35185**: This vulnerability (CVSS score of 8.8) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on SolarWinds ARM. The specific flaw exists within the `OpenFile` method. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. [1,2]\n- **CVE-2023-35186**: This vulnerability (CVSS score of 8.0) allows an authenticated user to abuse SolarWinds service resulting in remote code execution. [1]\n- **CVE-2023-35187**: This vulnerability (CVSS score of 8.8) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on SolarWinds ARM. The specific flaw exists within the `OpenClientUpdateFile` method. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. [1,3]\n\n# Affected Products\n\nAccess Rights Manager 2023.2.1 is a service release providing bug and security fixes for release 2023.2, although it doesn't explicitly list the vulnerable versions. [1]\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating to the latest version as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/arm/content/release_notes/arm_2023-2-1_release_notes.htm>\n\n[2] <https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-1565/>\n\n[3] <https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-1567/>\n",
