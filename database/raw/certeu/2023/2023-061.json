This exploit, named `BLASTPASS` could compromise iPhones running the latest iOS version without user interaction. The exploit involved `PassKit` attachments containing malicious images sent from an attacker iMessage account to the victim.\n\n_Citizen Lab_ promptly reported their findings to Apple, who issued two CVEs related to this exploit chain (CVE-2023-41064 and CVE-2023-41061). These vulnerabilities have now been patched in iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and macOS.\n\n# Technical Details\n\n## CVE-2023-41064 \n\nA buffer overflow issue was addressed with improved memory handling. This issue is fixed in macOS Ventura 13.5.2, iOS 16.6.1 and iPadOS 16.6.1. Processing a maliciously crafted image may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited [2].\n\n## CVE-2023-41061 \n\nA validation issue was addressed with improved logic. This issue is fixed in watchOS 9.6.2, iOS 16.6.1 and iPadOS 16.6.1. A maliciously crafted attachment may result in arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited [3].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nMacOS Ventura, watchOS, iOS and iPadOS devices.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends to update Apple devices.\n\nUsers who may face increased risk because of who they are or what they do could enable `Lockdown Mode` [4].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/>\n\n[2] <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41064>\n\n[3] <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41061>\n\n[4] <https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT212650>\n",
