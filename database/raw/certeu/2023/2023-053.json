Ivanti has released security patches [2] addressing this vulnerability.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe authentication bypass vulnerability in Ivanti's EPMM software, i.e., **CVE-2023-35078**,  grants unauthorised users access to restricted parts of the application without requiring appropriate authentication. By exploiting this vulnerability, an unauthorised, remote actor could access users personally identifiable information and make limited changes to the server [1].\n\nIt is important to note that all supported versions of the software, including versions 11.10, 11.9, and 11.8, are impacted by this vulnerability. Older versions or releases of the software are also at risk.\n\nDespite not publicly acknowledging that the vulnerability was actively exploited, Ivanti has received credible information indicating exploitation against a small number of customers [1].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThis vulnerability affects supported EPMM versions 11.10, 11.9, and 11.8. Unsupported older versions are also affected.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends reviewing Ivanti's security advisory [2] and upgrading affected systems to avoid potential exploitation of this vulnerability.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ivanti-patches-mobileiron-zero-day-bug-exploited-in-attacks/>\n\n[2] <https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/CVE-2023-35078-Remote-unauthenticated-API-access-vulnerability?language=en_US>",
