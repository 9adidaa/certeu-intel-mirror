The vulnerability is identified as `CVE-2023-20032` and could lead to remote code execution.  \n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability `CVE-2023-20032` lies in the HFS+ partition file parser of affected ClamAV versions and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is due to a missing buffer size check that may result in a heap buffer overflow write. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HFS+ partition file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV scanning process, or else crash the process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition [2].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe vulnerability affects the following ClamAV versions:\n\n- 0.103.7 and earlier\n- 0.105.1 and earlier\n- 1.0.0 and earlier\n\nMoreover, ClamAV **0.104 has reached end-of-life** and will not be patched. Anyone using ClamAV 0.104 must switch to a supported version [1].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends installing updates on all devices running ClamAV as soon as possible [1].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://blog.clamav.net/2023/02/clamav-01038-01052-and-101-patch.html?m=1>\n\n[2] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-clamav-q8DThCy>\n",
