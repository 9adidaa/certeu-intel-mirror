Although this is not an issue in the Citrix Hypervisor product itself, Citrix teams have included updated Intel microcode to mitigate this CPU hardware issue. This issue may allow unprivileged code in a guest VM to compromise that VM and, potentially, the host.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThese vulnerabilities affect the Citrix Hypervisor 8.2 CU1 LTSR.\n\n- CVE-2023-23583 only affects systems running on Intel Ice Lake or later CPUs.\n- CVE-2023-46835 only affects systems that have both of a PCI device passed through to the guest VM by the host administrator and also an AMD CPU. Customers who are not using AMD CPUs and customers who are not using the PCI pass-through feature are not affected by this issue.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended applying fixes as soon as possible [2].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX583037/citrix-hypervisor-security-bulletin-for-cve202323583-and-cve202346835>\n\n[2] <https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX583402/hotfix-xs82ecu1057-for-citrix-hypervisor-82-cumulative-update-1>",
