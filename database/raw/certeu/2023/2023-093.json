Other Chromium related projects depending on the `Skia` library might also be affected.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nUpdate the affected products to the latest versions available as soon as possible to mitigate the vulnerabilities. \n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_28.html>\n\n[2] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chrome-emergency-update-fixes-6th-zero-day-exploited-in-2023/>\n",
