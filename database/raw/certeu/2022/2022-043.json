The impact of this can include the reset of the administrator password at the next device reboot, allowing an attacker with ssh access to connect with the default administrator credentials after the device has rebooted. \n- `CVE-2022-27512` - Temporary disruption of the ADM license service. The impact of this includes preventing new licenses from being issued or renewed by Citrix ADM.\n\n# Affected Products\n\n- Citrix ADM 13.0 before 13.0-85.19\n- Citrix ADM 13.1 before 13.1-21.53\n\nCitrix has already updated the ADM cloud service, customers using it do not need to take additional action [1].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends to apply the patches provided by Citrix as soon as possible [2]. As a mitigation factor, Citrix recommends that network traffic to the Citrix ADM’s IP address is segmented, either physically or logically, from standard network traffic [2].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.securityweek.com/attackers-can-exploit-critical-citrix-adm-vulnerability-reset-admin-passwords>\n\n[2] <https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX460016/citrix-application-delivery-management-security-bulletin-for-cve202227511-and-cve202227512>\n",
