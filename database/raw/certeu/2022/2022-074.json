It is recommended to upgrade to the latest version of these products.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nIvanti did not release much technical details about the vulnerabilities, identified by `CVE-2022-35254`, and `CVE-2022-35258`, with CVSS scores of 7.5 out of 10. Nevertheless, the company specified that the vulnerabilities could lead to Denial-of-Service (DoS) conditions if exploited. Based on the CVSS scores, we can guess that the vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely and fairly easily.\n\n# Affected Products\n\n**CVE-2022-35254** and **CVE-2022-35258** affect:\n\n- Ivanti Policy Secure 9.1R16, 22.2R1 and below\n- Ivanti Neurons for Zero-Trust Gateway 22.2R1 and below\n- Ivanti Connect Secure 9.1R16.1, 22.2R1 and below\n\nThe Ivanti Neurons for Secure Access was affected by both vulnerabilities. Ivanti upgraded the hosted controller and completed the upgrade on October 9, 2022. There is no action for customers to take regarding the Ivanti Neurons for Secure Access Controller.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating the affected systems to the latest version.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA45520/?kA23Z000000GH5OSAW>\n",
