For a specific action to be affected, the action will also need to not perform any other authentication or authorization checks.\"_\n\nFor an app to be affected by CVE-2022-0540, both of the following conditions must be true:\n\n- it is installed in one of the affected Jira or Jira Service Management versions listed below,\n- it is using a configuration vulnerable to CVE-2022-0540.\n\n# Products Affected\n\n## Affected Jira Versions\n\nThis includes **Jira Core Server**, **Jira Software Server** and **Jira Software Data Center**\n\n- All versions before 8.13.18\n- 8.14.x\n- 8.15.x\n- 8.16.x\n- 8.17.x\n- 8.18.x\n- 8.19.x\n- 8.20.x before 8.20.6\n- 8.21.x\n\n## Affected Jira Service Management Versions\n\nThis includes **Jira Service Management Server** and **Jira Service Management Data Center**\n\n- All versions before 4.13.18\n- 4.14.x\n- 4.15.x\n- 4.16.x\n- 4.17.x\n- 4.18.x\n- 4.19.x\n- 4.20.x before 4.20.6\n- 4.21.x\n\n# Recommendations\n\nAtlassian recommends installing a fixed version of Jira or Jira Service Management to remediate CVE-2022-0540.\n\n## Fixed Jira Versions:\n\n- 8.13.x >= 8.13.18\n- 8.20.x >= 8.20.6\n- All versions >= 8.22.0\n\n## Fixed Jira Service Management Versions\n\n- 4.13.x >= 4.13.18\n- 4.20.x >= 4.20.6\n- All versions >= 4.22.0\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIf it is not possible to update to one of the versions above and you are using any affected apps, Atlassian recommends updating the affected apps to a version that has remediated the risk, or disabling the vulnerable apps until patching is possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/jira-security-advisory-2022-04-20-1115127899.html>\n",
