This vulnerability may lead to gaining control over the targeted system. The publication was last modified by Veeam on 18/03/2022 [1].\n\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe Veeam Distribution Service (TCP 9380 by default) allows unauthenticated users to access internal API functions. A remote attacker may send input to the internal API which may allow unauthenticated users to upload and execute malicious code on the affected products.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nAccording to Veeam the affected products are:\n\n- Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5\n- Veeam Backup & Replication 10\n- Veeam Backup & Replication 11\n\nHowever, all new deployments of Veeam Backup & Replication version 11a and 10a installed using the ISO images dated 20220302 or later are not vulnerable [1].\n\n\n# Recommendations and Mitigations\n\nCERT-EU recommends following the specific steps listed for each of the following version of the product:\n\nPatches are available for the following product versions [1]:\n\n- Veeam Backup & Replication 11a (build 11.0.1.1261 P20220302)\n- Veeam Backup & Replication 10a (build 10.0.1.4854 P20220304)\n\nThere is no patch for the Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5, because the support of the product has ended on January 2022 [4]. Veeam suggests upgrading to supported versions of the product [5].\n\nAs a temporary mitigation of the vulnerabilities it is suggested by Veeam to stop and disable the Veeam Distribution Service. The Veeam Distribution Service is installed on the Veeam Backup & Replication server and servers specified as distribution servers in Protection Groups.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.veeam.com/kb4288>\n\n[2] <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26500>\n\n[3] <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26501>\n\n[4] <https://www.veeam.com/product-lifecycle.html>\n\n[5] <https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/upgrade_vbr.html?ver=110>\n",
