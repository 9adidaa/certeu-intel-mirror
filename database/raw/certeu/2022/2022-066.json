A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to potentially cause denial-of-service conditions.[1]\n\n# Technical Details\n\nFrom the [BIND 9 Security Vulnerability Matrix](https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00913) published by ISC, four vulnerabilities have a 7.5 CVSS Score: \n\n- `CVE-2022-2906` - _Memory leaks in code handling Diffie-Hellman key exchange via TKEY RRs (OpenSSL 3.0.0+ only)_. [2]\n\nChanges between OpenSSL 1.x and OpenSSL 3.0 expose a flaw in `named` that causes a small memory leak in key processing when using TKEY records in Diffie-Hellman mode with OpenSSL 3.0.0 and later versions. An attacker can leverage this flaw to gradually erode available memory to the point where `named` crashes for lack of resources. Upon restart the attacker would have to begin again, but nevertheless there is the potential to deny service.\n\n\n- `CVE-2022-3080` - _BIND 9 resolvers configured to answer from stale cache with zero stale-answer-client-timeout may terminate unexpectedly._ [3]\n\nBIND 9 resolver can crash when stale cache and stale answers are enabled, option `stale-answer-client-timeout` is set to `0` and there is a stale CNAME in the cache for an incoming query. By sending specific queries to the resolver, an attacker can cause `named` to crash.\n\n- `CVE-2022-38177` and `CVE-2022-38178` - _Memory leak in ECDSA DNSSEC verification code._ [4][5]\n\nThe DNSSEC verification code for the ECDSA algorithm leaks memory when there is a signature length mismatch. By spoofing the target resolver with responses that have a malformed ECDSA signature, an attacker can trigger a small memory leak. It is possible to gradually erode available memory to the point where named crashes for lack of resources.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nMultiple versions of BIND 9.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends applying the necessary mitigation provided by ISC through [CVE-2022-2906](https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2022-2906), [CVE-2022-3080](https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2022-3080), [CVE-2022-38177](https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2022-38177), and [CVE-2022-38178](https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2022-38178).\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/09/22/isc-releases-security-advisories-multiple-versions-bind-9>\n\n[2] <https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2022-2906>\n\n[3] <https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2022-3080>\n\n[4] <https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2022-38177>\n\n[5] <https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2022-38178>\n",
