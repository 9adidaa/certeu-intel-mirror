This critical vulnerability is identified `CVE-2022-1680` with a severity score of 9.9 out of 10.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nWhen group SAML SSO is configured, the System for Cross-domain Management (SCIM) feature may allow any owner of a Premium group to invite arbitrary users through their username and email, then change those users' email addresses via SCIM to an attacker controlled email address and thus - in the absence of 2FA - take over those accounts. It is also possible for the attacker to change the display name and username of the targeted account [2].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe following versions of GitLab **Enterprise Edition** are affected [2]:\n\n- all versions starting from `11.10` and before `14.9.5`,\n- all versions starting from `14.10`and before `14.10.4`, \n- all versions starting from `15.0` and before `15.0.1`.\n\nTo be vulnerable, the servers must be configured with `SAML SSO` option enabled.\n\nPlease note that the Cloud version `GitLab.com` is already running the last version.\n\n# Recommendations \n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends updating GitLab servers to the last version. \n\nCERT-EU also recommends enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gitlab-security-update-fixes-critical-account-take-over-flaw/>\n\n[2] <https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/06/01/critical-security-release-gitlab-15-0-1-released/#account-take-over-via-scim-email-change>\n",
