  "description": "On September 28, 2022, the security researchers at Vietnamese cybersecurity vendor GTSC published a blog post claiming they have discovered an attack campaign which utilised two zero-day bugs in Microsoft Exchange that could allow an attacker a remote code execution. The attackers are chaining the pair of zero-days to deploy web shells, notably China Choppers, on compromised servers for persistence and data theft, as well as move laterally to other systems on the victims' networks.<br>Microsoft had identified the vulnerabilities as CVE-2022-41040, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, while the second, identified as CVE-2022-41082, allows remote code execution (RCE) when PowerShell is accessible to the attacker. CrowdStrike recently discovered a new exploit method (called OWASSRF) consisting of CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 to achieve remote code execution (RCE) through Outlook Web Access (OWA).",
