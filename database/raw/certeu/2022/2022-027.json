A vulnerability in the authentication functionality of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication controls and log into the device through the management interface.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThis vulnerability is due to the improper implementation of the password validation algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging into an affected device with crafted credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and log into the device as an administrator. The attacker could obtain privileges that are the same level as an administrative user but it depends on the crafted credentials [1]. \n\n# Affected Products\n\nThis vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.10.151.0 or Release 8.10.162.0 and have `macfilter` radius compatibility configured as `Other`:\n\n- 3504 Wireless Controller\n- 5520 Wireless Controller\n- 8540 Wireless Controller\n- Mobility Express\n- Virtual Wireless Controller (vWLC)\n\nThis vulnerability exists because of a non-default device configuration that must be present for it to be exploitable. To determine whether the Cisco WLC configuration is vulnerable, see [1] for details. \n\n# Recommendations\n\nCisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory [3]. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nThere are workarounds that address this vulnerability [1]. Choose one of the following based on the environment:\n\n**Option 1: No `macfilters` in the Environment**\n\nCustomers who do not use `macfilters` can reset the `macfilter` radius compatibility mode to the default value using the following CLI command:\n\n```\nwlc > config macfilter radius-compat cisco\n```\n\n**Option 2: `macfilters` in the Environment**\n\nCustomers who use `macfilters` and who are able to change the radius server configuration to match other possible compatibility modes can modify the macfilter compatibility to either cisco or free using one of the following CLI commands:\n\n```\nwlc > config macfilter radius-compat cisco\nwlc > config macfilter radius-compat free\n```\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wlc-auth-bypass-JRNhV4fF>\n\n[2] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-vulnerability-lets-hackers-craft-their-own-login-credentials/>\n\n[3] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu>\n",
