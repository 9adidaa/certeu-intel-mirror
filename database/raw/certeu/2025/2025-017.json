This vulnerability is being exploited in the wild.\n\nThe vulnerabilities **CVE-2025-26663** and **CVE-2025-26670**, both with a CVSS score of 8.1, are unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities caused by user-after-free weaknesses in the Windows Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). To be exploitable, they require an attacker to win a race condition via specially crafted requests sequentially sent to a vulnerable LDAP server.\n\nThe vulnerabilities **CVE-2025-27480** and **CVE-2025-27482**, both with a CVSS score of 8.1, are RCE vulnerabilities in Windows Remote Desktop Services (RDP). To exploit them, an attacker must first connect to a system with the Remote Desktop Gateway role and trigger a race condition to create an exploitable use-after-free scenario. \n\nThe vulnerabilities **CVE-2025-29791**, **CVE-2025-27749**, **CVE-2025-27748**, **CVE-2025-27745**, and **CVE-2025-27752**, all with a CVSS score of 7.8, are remote code execution flaws in Microsoft Office and Excel applications that could be exploited by a bad actor using a specially crafted Excel document, resulting in full system control.\n\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThese vulnerabilities affect several Microsoft products such as Windows 10 and 11, Windows Server, Microsoft Office, Hyper-V.\n\nPlease refer to the vendor website for more information for an exhaustive list of affected products [1].\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended updating as soon as possible, prioritising critical devices and public facing assets.\n\nIt is also recommended restricting access to affected services, such as RDP and LDAP, to only trusted sources.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2025-apr>\n\n[2] <https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/04/08/patch-tuesday-microsoft-zero-day-cve-2025-29824/>\n\n[3] <https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/microsoft-patches-126-flaws-including.html>",
