An unauthenticated attacker could send specific requests to the API endpoint to write arbitrary data outside the bound of the intended buffer and execute arbitrary code or commands.\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-22252** [2], with a CVSS score of 9.0, is a missing authentication for critical function vulnerability in FortiOS, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitchManager TACACS+ configured to use a remote TACACS+ server for authentication, that has itself been configured to use ASCII authentication. This may allow an attacker with knowledge of an existing admin account to access the device as a valid admin via an authentication bypass.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-32756** affects the following product versions:\n\n- FortiVoice versions 6.4.0 through 6.4.10, 7.0.0 through 7.0.6, and 7.2.0\n- FortiRecorder versions 6.4.0 through 6.4.5, 7.0.0 through 7.0.5 and 7.2.0 through 7.2.3\n- FortiMail versions 7.0.0 through 7.0.8, 7.2.0 through 7.2.7, 7.4.0 through 7.4.4, and 7.6.0 through 7.6.2\n- FortiNDR versions 1.1 to 1.4, 1.5.0 through 1.5.3, 7.0.0 through 7.0.6, 7.1.0 through 7.1.1, 7.2.0 through 7.2.4, 7.4.0 through 7.4.7 and 7.6.0.\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-22252** affects the following product versions:\n\n- FortiOS versions 7.4.4 through 7.4.6, and 7.6.0\n- FortiProxy versions 7.6.0 through 7.6.1\n- FortiSwitchManager version 7.2.5\n\n_This vulnerability is limited to configurations where ASCII authentication is used. PAP, MSCHAP, and CHAP configurations are not impacted._ \n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended to upgrade to a fixed version as soon as possible.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nTo mitigate the vulnerability **CVE-2025-32756**, it is possible to disable the web (HTTP/HTTPS) service on the administrative interface [1].\n\nTo mitigate the vulnerability **CVE-2025-22252**, it is possible to use an alternate authentication method [2].\n\n## Detection\n\nThere are several detection opportunities related to the exploitation of **CVE-2025-32756**.\n\n1. Audit logs: the following log entries are indicative of exploitation of the vulnerability\n\n```\nOutput of CLI command 'diagnose debug application httpd display trace-log':\n[x x x x:x:x.x 2025] [fcgid:warn] [pid 1829] [client x.x.x.x:x] mod_fcgid: error reading data, FastCGI server closed connection\n[x x x x:x:x.x 2025] [fcgid:error] [pid 1503] mod_fcgid: process /migadmin/www/fcgi/admin.fe(1741) exit(communication error), get unexpected signal 11\n```\n\n2. IP addresses associated to the Threat Actor exploiting this vulnerability:\n\n- `198.105.127[.]124`\n- `43.228.217[.]173`\n- `43.228.217[.]82`\n- `156.236.76[.]90`\n- `218.187.69[.]244`\n- `218.187.69[.]59`\n\n2. Modified settings:\n\nVerify if `fcgi` debugging is enabled on your system, use the following CLI command:\n\n```\n> diag debug application fcgi\n\nfcgi debug level is 0x80041\ngeneral to-file ENABLED\n```\n\nThis is not a default setting, so unless you have enabled it in the past, this is potentially an Indicator of Compromise\n\n3. File modifications:\n\n- [Added File] `/bin/wpad_ac_helper`\n- [Added File] `/bin/busybox`\n- [Modified File] `/data/etc/crontab`\n- [Modified File] `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root`\n- [Added File] `/var/spool/.sync`\n- [Modified File] `/etc/pam.d/sshd`\n- [Added File] `/lib/libfmlogin.so`\n- [Added File] `/tmp/.sshdpm`\n- [Added File] `/bin/fmtest`\n- [Modified File] `/etc/httpd.conf`\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-25-254>\n\n[2] <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-24-472>",
