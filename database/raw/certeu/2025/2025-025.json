An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by submitting a crafted API request. A successful exploit could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as root.\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-20282**, with a CVSS score of 10, is due to a lack of file validation checks that would prevent uploaded files from being placed in privileged directories on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted file to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store malicious files on the affected system and then execute arbitrary code or obtain root privileges on the system.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe following product versions are affected by the vulnerabilities:\n\n- Cisco ISE or ISE-PIC Release 3.3 before Patch 7\n- Cisco ISE or ISE-PIC Release 3.4 before Patch 2\n\n_Note: Cisco warns that customers who applied the patches for CVE-2025-20281 and CVE-2025-20282 are not covered for CVE-2025-20337, and need to upgrade to ISE 3.3 Patch 7 or ISE 3.4 Patch 2._\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended updating affected devices as soon as possible.\n\n# References \n\n[1] <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-unauth-rce-ZAd2GnJ6>",
