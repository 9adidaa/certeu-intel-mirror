At least one critical vulnerability is known to be exploited in the wild.\n\nIt recommended updating as soon as possible, and if not possible, at least applying mitigations.\n\n# Technical Details\n\n- The vulnerability **CVE-2024-55591**, with a CVSS score of 9.6, is an authentication bypass in `Node.js` websocket module in FortiOS and FortiProxy which allow a remote attacker to gain super-admin privileges via crafted requests to `Node.js` websocket module. This vulnerability affects the management interface. This vulnerability is exploited in the wild [2].\n- The vulnerability **CVE-2023-37936**, with a CVSS score of 9.6, is a use of hard-coded cryptographic key vulnerability in FortiSwitch and allows a remote unauthenticated attacker in possession of the key to execute unauthorised code via crafted cryptographic requests [3].\n\nFortinet also addresses 13 other high severity vulnerabilities.\n\n# Affected Products\n\n- The vulnerability **CVE-2024-55591** affects FortiOS versions 7.0.0 through 7.0.16, and FortiProxy 7.0.0 through 7.0.19 and 7.2.0 through 7.2.12.\n- The vulnerability **CVE-2023-37936** affects FortiSwitch versions:\n    - 6.0.0 through 6.0.7;\n    - 6.2.0 through 6.2.7;\n    - 6.4.0 through 6.4.13;\n    - 7.0.0 through 7.0.7;\n    - 7.2.0 through 7.2.5;\n    - 7.4.0.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended updating as soon as possible. Considering that the vulnerability **CVE-2024-55591** is exploited in the wild, it recommended to look for indicators of compromise (IoCs). When IoCs are found, it is recommended to trigger the Incident Response process.\n\n## Detection\n\nFortinet has provided possible IoCs to look for potential exploitation of the vulnerability **CVE-2024-55591**:\n\n### In the logs\n\n- Following login activity log with random `scrip` and `dstip`:\n\n```\ntype=\"event\" subtype=\"system\" level=\"information\" vd=\"root\" logdesc=\"Admin login successful\" sn=\"1733486785\" user=\"admin\" ui=\"jsconsole\" method=\"jsconsole\" srcip=1.1.1.1 dstip=1.1.1.1 action=\"login\" status=\"success\" reason=\"none\" profile=\"super_admin\" msg=\"Administrator admin logged in successfully from jsconsole\"\n```\n\n- Following admin creation log with seemingly randomly generated user name and source IP:\n\n```\ntype=\"event\" subtype=\"system\" level=\"information\" vd=\"root\" logdesc=\"Object attribute configured\" user=\"admin\" ui=\"jsconsole(127.0.0.1)\" action=\"Add\" cfgtid=1411317760 cfgpath=\"system.admin\" cfgobj=\"vOcep\" cfgattr=\"password[*]accprofile[super_admin]vdom[root]\" msg=\"Add system.admin vOcep\"\n```\n\nThe following IP addresses were mostly found used by attackers in the above logs:\n\n- `1.1.1.1`\n- `127.0.0.1`\n- `2.2.2.2`\n- `8.8.8.8`\n- `8.8.4.4`\n\n_Please note that the above IP parameters are under attacker control and therefore can be any other IP address. Please note as well that sn and `cfgtid` are not relevant to the attack._\n\n- Logging in the `sslvpn` with the above added local users to get a tunnel to the internal network. the Threat Action has been seen using the following IP addresses:\n    - `45.55.158.47` [most used IP address]\n    - `87.249.138.47`\n    - `155.133.4.175`\n    - `37.19.196.65`\n    - `149.22.94.37`\n\n### In the device configuration\n\nThe operations performed by the Threat Actor (TA) in the cases we observed were part or all of the below:\n\n- Creating an admin account on the device with random user name\n- Creating a Local user account on the device with random user name\n- Creating a user group or adding the above local user to an existing sslvpn user group\n- Adding/changing other settings (firewall policy, firewall address, ...)\n\n## Workarounds\n\nAs a workaround, Fortinet recommends to disable HTTP/HTTPS administrative interface or Limit IP addresses that can reach the administrative interface via local-in policies [2].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt?filter=1&product=FortiOS-6K7K%2CFortiOS&product=FortiSwitch&product=FortiSwitchManager&product=FortiAP&product=FortiAP-U&product=FortiAP-W2&product=FortiAP-S&product=FortiAP-C&product=FortiManager&product=FortiAnalyzer&product=FortiAnalyzer-BigData&product=FortiManager+Cloud&product=FortiAnalyzer+Cloud&product=FortiSandbox&product=FortiExtender&version=&date=2025>\n\n[2] <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-24-535>\n\n[3] <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-23-260>",
