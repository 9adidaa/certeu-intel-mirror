If exploited, it could allow an attacker with access to a valid signed SAML document to impersonate another user within the same SAML IdP environment. This can result in unauthorised access to another user's account.\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2025-27407** is a high-severity remote code execution issue in the Ruby `graphql` library. If exploited, it allows an authenticated attacker to exploit the Direct Transfer feature (disabled by default) for remote code execution.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThese vulnerabilities affect GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE) versions prior to 17.7.7, 17.8.5, and 17.9.2.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends upgrading affected servers as soon as possible, prioritising Internet facing assets.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIf immediate remediation is not possible, consider the following temporary mitigation:\n\n- Ensure all users have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled.\n- Disable the `SAML two-factor bypass` option.\n- Request admin approval for auto-created users by setting:\n\n```gitlab_rails['omniauth_block_auto_created_users'] = true```\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/03/12/patch-release-gitlab-17-9-2-released/>",
