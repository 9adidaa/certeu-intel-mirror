This could allow the attacker to perform actions on the device with the permissions of the victim.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nCSRF is an attack that forces an end-user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated [2]. An attacker can trick the victim to follow a malicious link and thus allow the attacker to perform actions on the device with the permissions of the victim. The vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software with the HTTP Server feature enabled. The risk depends on the version of the software.\n\n# Products Affected\n\nSystem owners should use the CISCO IOS Software Checker [3] to determine if their devices are vulnerable.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n* Disable HTTP Server until an update of the software is completed.\n* Update the software following the vendor's guidelines [1].\n\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190612-iosxe-csrf#fs>\n\n[2] <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)>\n\n[3] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x>\n",
