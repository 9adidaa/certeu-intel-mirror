The vulnerability identified as CVE-2019-1804 is a hardcoded SSH key pair that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to connect to the affected system with the privileges of the root user.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability is due to the presence of a default SSH key pair that is present in all affected devices. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening an SSH connection via IPv6 to a targeted device using the extracted key materials. An exploit could allow the attacker to access the system with the privileges of the _root_ user. This vulnerability is only exploitable over IPv6 -- IPv4 is not vulnerable [1].\n\n# Products Affected\n\nThis vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode Switch Software.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nThere are no workarounds to address this vulnerability. Cisco has released software updates to fix the defective software and for other issues [2].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-nexus9k-sshkey>\n\n[2] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x>\n",
