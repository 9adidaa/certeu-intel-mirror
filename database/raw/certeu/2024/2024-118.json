The vulnerability tracked as **CVE-2024-11477** has received a high CVSS score of 7.8 [1].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThis vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of 7-Zip. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation [2].\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of `Zstandard` decompression. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow before writing to memory.
