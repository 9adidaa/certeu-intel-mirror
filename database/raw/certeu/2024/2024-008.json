It allows a network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS), or Remote Code Execution (RCE) and obtain root privileges on the device.\n\nTo be vulnerable, at least one of the following configurations needs to be used on the device:\n\n- `[system services web-management http]`\n- `[system services web-management https]`\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS SRX Series and EX Series:\n\n- Junos OS versions earlier than 20.4R3-S9;\n- Junos OS 21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S7;\n- Junos OS 21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;\n- Junos OS 21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5;\n- Junos OS 22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4;\n- Junos OS 22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3;\n- Junos OS 22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S2;\n- Junos OS 22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is strongly recommended upgrading all Junos OS to one of the fixed versions (or newer). It is also recommended limiting the J-Web configuration interface access to only trusted hosts and networks.\n\n## Workaround\n\nIf the update is not possible, a workaround is possible by disabling J-Web, or limit J-Web access to only trusted hosts.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://supportportal.juniper.net/s/article/2024-01-Security-Bulletin-Junos-OS-SRX-Series-and-EX-Series-Security-Vulnerability-in-J-web-allows-a-preAuth-Remote-Code-Execution-CVE-2024-21591>\n",
