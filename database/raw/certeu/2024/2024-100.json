Following this, on October 21, 2024, Broadcom updated their advisory [2] with additional information about another related vulnerability tracked as **CVE-2024-38813**. \n\n# Technical Details\n\n- The critical vulnerability **CVE-2024-38812** is caused by a heap overflow in vCenter Server's DCE/RPC protocol implementation. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code without user interaction.\n\n- Another high-severity vulnerability, **CVE-2024-38813**, enables privilege escalation to root via specially crafted network packets.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe following products are affected:\n\n- VMware vCenter Server 7.0 (fixed in 7.0 U3s) and 8.0 (fixed in 8.0 U3b)\n- VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x (fixed in async patch to 7.0 U3s) and 5.x (fixed in async patch to 8.0 U3b)\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends to apply the available patches via the VMware Security Advisory [2].\n\nThe VCenter patches released on September 17, 2024 did not completely address CVE-2024-38812. The patches listed in [2] are updated versions that contain additional fixes to fully address CVE-2024-38812.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/broadcom-fixes-critical-rce-bug-in-vmware-vcenter-server/>\n\n[2] <https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/24968>",
