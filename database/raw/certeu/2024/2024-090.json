By sending specially crafted DHCPv6 packets to an affected device, an attacker could cause the `dhcp_snoop` process to crash and restart multiple times, eventually forcing the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition [3].\n\nOther vulnerabilities addressed in this update include a medium-severity **Command Injection** flaw in the NX-OS CLI that could allow local attackers to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges, and multiple medium-severity **Privilege Escalation** flaws in the NX-OS sandbox environment that could allow authenticated local attackers to escape the Python sandbox and gain unauthorised access to the underlying operating system.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2024-20446** affects Cisco Nexus 3000 and 7000 Series Switches and Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode if all the following conditions are true [3]:\n\n- They are running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 8.2(11), 9.3(9), or 10.2(1).\n- They have the DHCPv6 relay agent enabled.\n- They have at least one IPv6 address configured on the device.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends applying the latest NX-OS patches provided by Cisco.
