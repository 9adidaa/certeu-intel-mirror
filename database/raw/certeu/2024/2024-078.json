This flaw allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and create rogue administrator accounts, posing a significant security risk. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability, tracked as `CVE-2024-7593`, is caused by an incorrect authentication algorithm, enabling attackers to bypass the authentication process on Internet-exposed vTM admin panels. Exploitation could lead to unauthorised access and control over the affected system.\n\n# Affected Products\n\n| Product Name  | Affected Version(s) | Resolved Version(s) | Patch Availability |\n|---------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Ivanti Virtual Traffic Manager      | 22.2                | 22.2R1              | Available                |\n| Ivanti Virtual Traffic Manager      | 22.3                | 22.3R3              | Week of August 19th      |\n| Ivanti Virtual Traffic Manager      | 22.3R2              | 22.3R3              | Week of August 19th      |\n| Ivanti Virtual Traffic Manager      | 22.5R1              | 22.5R2              | Week of August 19th      |\n| Ivanti Virtual Traffic Manager      | 22.6R1              | 22.6R2              | Week of August 19th      |\n| Ivanti Virtual Traffic Manager      | 22.7R1              | 22.7R2              | Available                |\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends updating to the latest patched version of Ivanti vTM. Additionally, restrict access to the management interface by binding it to an internal network or private IP address to reduce the attack surface.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ivanti-warns-of-critical-vtm-auth-bypass-with-public-exploit/>\n",
