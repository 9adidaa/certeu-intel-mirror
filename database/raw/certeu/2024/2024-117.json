If exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to gain administrator privileges, or a PAN-OS administrator to perform actions on the firewall with root privileges [1,2].\n\nIt recommended applying the updates and restricting the access to the management web interface to only trusted internal IP addresses, according to the vendor's best practice deployment guidelines [3].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2024-0012**, with a CVSS score of 9.3, is an authentication bypass flaw in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software. It enables an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the management web interface to gain PAN-OS administrator privileges to perform administrative actions, tamper with the configuration, or exploit other authenticated privilege escalation vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-9474 [1].\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2024-9474**, with a CVSS score of 6.9, is a privilege escalation flaw in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software. It allows a PAN-OS administrator with access to the management web interface to perform actions on the firewall with root privileges [2].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe following PAN-OS versions are affected by **CVE-2024-0012** and **CVE-2024-9474**:\n\n- PAN-OS 11.2 before 11.2.4-h1\n- PAN-OS 11.1 before 11.1.5-h1\n- PAN-OS 11.0 before 11.0.6-h1\n- PAN-OS 10.2 before 10.2.12-h2\n\nThe PAN-OS 10.1 versions before 10.1.14-h6 are also affected by **CVE-2024-9474**.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends applying updates to the affected devices as soon as possible. It is also strongly recommended restricting access to the management web interface.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-0012>\n\n[2] <https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-9474>\n\n[3] <https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431>\n\n",
