Four of these vulnerabilities have been classified as high severity due to their potential to facilitate session hijacking and to lead to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. [1,2] \n\n# Technical Details\n\n**CVE-2024-39809**, with a CVSS score 8.9, is a vulnerability that facilitates session hijacking. It allows an attacker who obtains a user's session cookie to continue using that session to access the BIG-IP Next Central Manager and managed systems, even after the user logs out. This vulnerability impacts the control plane, enabling unauthorised access without affecting data plane operations [3].\n\n**CVE-2024-39778**, with a CVSS score 8.7, allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger a system reboot, disrupting traffic and causing a denial-of-service (DoS) on the BIG-IP system. While this vulnerability affects the data plane by interrupting service, there is no control exposure [4].\n\n**CVE-2024-39792**, with a CVSS score 8.7, allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to degrade the performance of the NGINX service until the master and worker processes are restarted. Continued degradation can escalate into a denial-of-service (DoS). The impact is restricted to the data plane, with no exposure of the control plane [5].\n\n**CVE-2024-41727**, with a CVSS score 8.7, allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to degrade system performance by impacting the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) process. If the TMM process is not restarted, the degradation can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) on the BIG-IP system. This vulnerability affects only the data plane, with no exposure of the control plane [6].\n\n\n# Affected Products\n\n- **CVE-2024-39809** affects BIG-IP Next Central Manager version 20.1.0.\t\n- **CVE-2024-39778** affects BIG-IP (all modules) versions 17.1.0, 16.1.0 through 16.1.4, and 15.1.0 through 15.1.10.\n- **CVE-2024-39792** affects NGINX Plus versions R30 through R32\n- **CVE-2024-41727** affects BIG-IP (all modules) versions 16.1.0 through 16.1.4 and 15.1.0 through 15.1.10.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended applying updates to the affected assets as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n\n[1] <https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000140552>\n\n[2] <https://www.securityweek.com/f5-patches-high-severity-vulnerabilities-in-big-ip-nginx-plus/>\n\n[3] <https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000140111>\n\n[4] <https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K05710614>\n\n[5] <https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000140108>\n\n[6] <https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000138833>\n",
