This security flaw is caused by an information disclosure weakness that enables unauthorised actors to access protected information [1].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability **CVE-2024-38200** (CVSS score: 7.5) is an information disclosure vulnerability that allows remote attackers to access NTLM hashes. Attackers can exploit this flaw via a specially crafted file or web-based attack, potentially leading to NTLM relay attacks or password cracking.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nAccording to Microsoft's advisory, the following products are affected [4]:\n\n- Microsoft Office 2016 (64-bit edition)\n- Microsoft Office 2016 (32-bit edition)\n- Microsoft Office LTSC 2021 for 32-bit editions\n- Microsoft Office LTSC 2021 for 64-bit editions\n- Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise for 64-bit Systems\n- Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise for 32-bit Systems\n- Microsoft Office 2019 for 64-bit editions\n- Microsoft Office 2019 for 32-bit editions\n\n# Mitigations\n\n1. Set the \"Restrict NTLM: Outgoing NTLM traffic to remote servers\" group policy to block NTLM traffic from computers running Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, or later to any remote server [2].\n\n2. Add users to the Protected Users Security Group, which restricts NTLM as an authentication method [3].\n\n3. Block all outbound traffic on TCP port 445 to prevent NTLM traffic from leaving the network.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends applying the mitigations provided by Microsoft [4], including blocking outbound NTLM traffic, while Microsoft releases the updates.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-discloses-unpatched-office-flaw-that-exposes-ntlm-hashes/>\n\n[2] <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-outgoing-ntlm-traffic-to-remote-servers#policy-management>\n\n[3] <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/protected-users-security-group>\n\n[4] <https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-38200>",
