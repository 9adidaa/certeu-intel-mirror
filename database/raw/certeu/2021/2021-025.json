One of the vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21985) has a critical CVSSv3 score. It may allow an attacker to execute command with unrestricted privileges on the operating system that hosts vCenter Server.\n\nAs of the beginning of June, 2021, a proof-of-concept of a RCE exploit targeting the critical vulnerability has been published. This indicates imminent exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability tracked as CVE-2021-21985 was reported initially by Ricter Z. from 360 Noah Lab, and it can be remotely exploited by unauthenticated attackers in low complexity attacks which do not require user interaction [7].\n\nA malicious actor with network access on port 443 of the vCenter Server appliances may execute command remotely with unrestricted privileges on the underlying host. This is due to a lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN Health Check plug-in, which is enabled by default. The severity of this issue has been evaluated with CVSSv3 score of 9.8 by VMware [1]. Additional information has also been provided by VMWare in [6].\n\nAt the beginning of June, Security Researchers have developed and published a proof-of-concept of a RCE exploit targeting CVE-2021-21985. Moreover, threat intelligence company has monitored attackers scanning actively for Internet-exposed VMware vCenter servers unpatched interface. According to Shodan, thousands of vCenter servers are still reachable from the Internet and may be vulnerable to CVE-2021-21985 [8].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe following products are affected by the vulnerabilities :\n\n| Product           | Affected Versions                    |Platform       |\n|:-----------------:|:-----------------------------------------|:---------:|\n|vCenter Server 7.0 | vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2a and earlier | Any       |\n|vCenter Server 6.7 | vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3m and earlier | Any       |\n|vCenter Server 6.5 | vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3n and earlier | Any       |\n\n# Recommendations\n\nVMware has released updates that fixes the two vulnerabilities CVE-2021-21985 and CVE-2021-21986 [2, 3, 4] and a workaround [5] showing how to disable VMware plugins in vCenter Server.\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends patching vCenter Server to the fixed version of the table below:\n\n| Product         | Fixed Version   |\n|:---------------:|:---------------:|\n|vCenter Server 7.0 | 7.0 U2b       |\n|vCenter Server 6.7 | 6.7 U3n       |\n|vCenter Server 6.5 | 6.5 U3p       |\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0010.html>\n\n[2] <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-vcenter-server-70u2b-release-notes.html>\n\n[3] <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/rn/vsphere-vcenter-server-67u3n-release-notes.html>\n\n[4] <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/rn/vsphere-vcenter-server-65u3p-release-notes.html>\n\n[5] <https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/83829>\n\n[6] <https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2021/05/vmsa-2021-0010.html>\n\n[7] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vmware-warns-of-critical-bug-affecting-all-vcenter-server-installs/>\n\n[8] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/attackers-are-scanning-for-vulnerable-vmware-servers-patch-now/>\n",
