It could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. The attacker must have network access to the GlobalProtect interface to exploit this issue [1].\n\nOnly PAN-OS firewall configurations with a GlobalProtect portal or gateway enabled are vulnerable.\n\n# Products affected\n\nThis issue impacts `PAN-OS 8.1` versions earlier than `PAN-OS 8.1.17` [1].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU strongly recommends updating or upgrading affected versions of PAN-OS to a non-vulnerable version.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nPalo Alto recommends enabling signatures for Unique Threat IDs `91820` and `91855` on traffic destined for GlobalProtect portal and gateway interfaces to block attacks against `CVE-2021-3064`[1].
