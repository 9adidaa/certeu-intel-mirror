  "content_markdown": "---\ntitle: 'MobileIron Critical Vulnerability'\nversion: '1.0'\nnumber: '2021-070'\ndate: 'January 17, 2021'\n---\n\n_History:_\n\n* _16/12/2021 --- v1.0 -- Initial publication_\n* _17/01/2022 --- v1.0 -- Edit the affected versions section for MobileIron Sentry_\n\n# Summary\n\nOn December 15th, Ivanti updated its advisory related to `CVE-2021-44228` vulnerability affecting MobileIron products [2]. While this CVE affects the Java logging library `log4j` [1], all products using this library are vulnerable to Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the Java logging library `log4j`. An unauthenticated remote attacker might exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted content to the application to execute malicious code on the server [1].\n\n# Affected products\n\n- MobileIron Core  (All Versions)\n- MobileIron Sentry 9.13 and 9.14\n- MobileIron Core Connector  (All Versions)\n- MobileIron Core RDB  (All Versions)\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIvanti provided guidance to mitigate the vulnerably on its various affected products:\n\n1. Connect to the server CLI via SSH protocol;\n2. Use the command `enable` to elevate privileges;\n3. Install the workaround using one of the following commands (depending on the product you are updating):\n\n```\ninstall rpm url https://supportcdn.mobileiron.com/log4j-jndi/current/mi-workaround-log4j-jndi-vulnerability-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm # MobileIron Core\ninstall rpm url https://supportcdn.mobileiron.com/log4j-jndi/current/mi-workaround-sentry-log4j-jndi-vulnerability-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm # MobileIron Sentry\ninstall rpm url https://supportcdn.mobileiron.com/log4j-jndi/current/mi-workaround-connector-log4j-jndi-vulnerability-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm # MobileIron Core Connector\ninstall rpm url https://supportcdn.mobileiron.com/log4j-jndi/current/mi-workaround-rdb-log4j-jndi-vulnerability-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm  # MobileIron Core RDB\n```\n\n4. Accept the service restart (`y`).\n\nNotes:\n\n- If FIPS mode is enabled on the server, then the effects of the installation will not persist across reboots. This means the RPM installation will need to be re-performed immediately after the system comes back up after a reboot.\n- If the server is upgraded, then the RPM installation will need to be re-performed, unless the version being upgraded to has a fix to the issue.\n- For Sentry, the RPM installation is applicable only to Sentry 9.13 and above. Versions prior to that are not vulnerable.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://media.cert.europa.eu/static/SecurityAdvisories/2021/CERT-EU-SA2021-067.pdf>\n\n[2] <https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Bulletin-CVE-2021-44228-Remote-code-injection-in-Log4j>\n",
