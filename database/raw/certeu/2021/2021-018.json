These vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges on an affected system.

These vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to **execute arbitrary code** or allow an authenticated, local attacker to **gain escalated privileges** on an affected system. While Cisco is not aware of any malicious exploit in the wild, it is highly recommended to patch the affected products.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThis advisory only describes the most critical vulnerabilities disclosed by Cisco for enterprise products.\n\n## CVE-2021-1479\n\nThe first vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input to the vulnerable component. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted connection request to the vulnerable component that, when processed, could cause a buffer overflow condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system with _root_ privileges.\n\n## CVE-2021-1137\n\nThe second vulnerability, is due to insufficient input validation by the affected software. An authenticated attacker who has permissions to add new users or groups on the vManage system could exploit this vulnerability by modifying a user account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain _root_ privileges on the underlying operating system.  \n\n## CVE-2021-1480\n\nThe third vulnerability, is due to improper validation of input to the system file transfer functions. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the vulnerable system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files and modify the system in such a way that could allow the attacker to gain _root_ privileges on the underlying operating system.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe following products could be affected by the vulnerabilities:\n\n* IOS XE SD-WAN Software\n* SD-WAN cEdge Routers\n* SD-WAN vBond Orchestrator Software\n* SD-WAN vEdge Routers\n* SD-WAN vSmart Controller Software\n\nThe following software releases are affected by the vulnerabilities:\n\n\n|Cisco SD-WAN vManage Release |\tFirst Fixed Release |\n|-|-|-|\n|18.4 and earlier |\tMigrate to a fixed branch (19.2) |\n|19.2| \t19.2.4|\n|19.3| \tMigrate to a fixed branch (20.3 or later) |\n|20.1| \tMigrate to a fixed branch (20.3 or later) |\n|20.3| \t20.3.3|\n|20.4| \t20.4.1|\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended to apply the patches from Cisco for all affected software and products.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanage-YuTVWqy>\n\n[2] <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-1137>\n\n[3] <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-1479>\n\n[4] <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-1480>\n",
