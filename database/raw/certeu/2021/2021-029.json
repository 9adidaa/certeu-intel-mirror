Severity is **critical** with a CVSSv3.1 Base Score: 9.8 [1].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nAn improper authorisation vulnerability in some versions of Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR enables a remote unauthenticated attacker with network access to the Cortex XSOAR server to perform unauthorised actions through the REST API [1].\n\nThe vulnerability received CVE-2021-3044 [2]\n\n# Products Affected\n\n- Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0 builds later than 1016923 and earlier than 1271064;\n- Cortex XSOAR 6.2.0 builds earlier than 1271065.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nThis issue is fixed in Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0 build 1271064, Cortex XSOAR 6.2.0 build 1271065, and all later Cortex XSOAR versions.\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating the vulnerable application as soon as possible.\n\n## Workarounds and Mitigations\n\nTo fully mitigate the impact of this issue, all active integration API keys must be revoked.\n\nTo revoke integration API keys from the Cortex XSOAR web client go to _Settings_ > _Integration_ > _API Keys_ and then _Revoke_ each API key.\n\nYou can create new API keys after you upgrade Cortex XSOAR to a fixed version.\n\nRestricting network access to the Cortex XSOAR server to allow only trusted users also reduces the impact of this issue.
