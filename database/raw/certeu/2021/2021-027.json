The medium severity vulnerability is a network-based denial-of-service. The high severity vulnerability is a SAML authentication hijacking caused by an improper access control [2].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nCVE-2020-8299 is a network-based denial-of-service vulnerability. The attacker must be in the same Layer 2 network segment as the vulnerable appliance and the affected products are Citrix ADC, Citrix Gateway and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP.\n\nCVE-2020-8300 is a SAML authentication hijack vulnerability caused by an improper access control. By using a phishing attack, the exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to steal a valid user session. The affected products are Citrix ADC or Citrix Gateway which must be configured as a SAML SP or a SAML IdP.\n\nThere are no additional technical details shared by Citrix.\n\n# Products Affected\n\nCVE-2020-8299 affects the following supported versions of Citrix ADC, Citrix Gateway and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP:\n\n- Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-76.29\n- Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 12.1 before 12.1-61.18\n- Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway 11.1 before 65.20\n- Citrix ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.238\n- Citrix SD-WAN WANOP 11.4 before 11.4.0\n- Citrix SD-WAN WANOP 11.3 before 11.3.2\n- Citrix SD-WAN WANOP 11.3 before 11.3.1a\n- Citrix SD-WAN WANOP 11.2 before 11.2.3a\n- Citrix SD-WAN WANOP 11.1 before 11.1.2c\n- Citrix SD-WAN WANOP 10.2 before 10.2.9a\n\n\nCVE-2020-8300 is applied to the following supported versions of Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway:\n\n- Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 13.0. before 13.0-82.41\n- Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 12.1 before 12.1-62.23\n- Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway 11.1 before 11.1-65.20\n- Citrix ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.238\n\n\nThese issues have already been addressed in Citrix-managed cloud services such as Citrix Gateway Service and Citrix Secure Workspace Access. Customers using Citrix-managed services do not need to take any additional action.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCitrix recommends the affected customers to install relevant updates as soon as possible.\n\nFor CVE-2020-8300, when the Citrix ADC and/or Citrix Cloud Gateway are used as a SAML SP, SAML IdP, or both, upgrade to at least the following versions:\n\n- Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 13.0-82.41\n- Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway ADC 12.1-62.23\n- Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway 11.1-65.20\n- Citrix ADC 12.1-FIPS 12.1-55.238\n\nFor CVE-2020-8299, the Citrix ADC, Citrix Gateway, and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP should be upgraded to at least the following versions:  \n\n- Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 13.0-76.29\n- Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 12.1-61.18\n- Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway 11.1-65.20\n- Citrix ADC 12.1-FIPS 12.1-55.238\n- Citrix SD-WAN WANOP 11.4.0\n- Citrix SD-WAN WANOP 11.3.2\n- Citrix SD-WAN WANOP 11.3.1a\n- Citrix SD-WAN WANOP 11.2.3a\n- Citrix SD-WAN WANOP 11.1.2c\n- Citrix SD-WAN WANOP 10.2.9a\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX297155>\n\n[2] <https://dirteam.com/sander/2021/06/08/saml-authentication-hijack-vulnerability-on-citrix-adc-and-citrix-gateway-appliances-cve-2020-8300/>\n",
