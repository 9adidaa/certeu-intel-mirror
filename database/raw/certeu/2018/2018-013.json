  "description": "On May 2nd, 2018, Cisco published two advisories for remote code execution vulnerabilities, CVE-2018-0287 (medium) and CVE-2018-0264 (critical) in the various Cisco WebEx Players. The players are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded by an online meeting attendee. The records are using the Advanced Recording Format (ARF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a link or an e-mail attachment with a malicious ARF file and persuading the target to open the malicious file. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.",

The records are using the Advanced Recording Format (ARF). On May 2nd, 2018, Cisco published two advisories for remote code execution vulnerabilities:\n\n * CVE-2018-0287 (medium) [1]\n * CVE-2018-0264 (critical) [2]\n\n An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a link or an e-mail attachment with a malicious ARF file and persuading the target to open the malicious file. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.\n\n# Products Affected\n\nThe following products are affected by both vulnerabilities:\n\n * Cisco WebEx Business Suite meeting sites,\n * Cisco WebEx Meetings sites,\n * Cisco WebEx Meetings Server,\n * Cisco WebEx ARF players.\n\nRegarding the critical vulnerability (CVE-2018-0264), Cisco provides a list of affected client builds:\n\n * Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds prior to T31.23.4,\n * Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS32) client builds prior to T32.12,\n * Cisco WebEx Meetings with client builds prior to T32.12,\n * Cisco WebEx Meeting Server builds prior to 3.0 Patch 1.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nUpgrade to the most recent version of Cisco WebEx players:\n\n * Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds T31.23.4 and later,\n * Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS32) client builds T32.12 and later,\n * Cisco WebEx Meetings with client builds T32.12 and later,\n * Cisco WebEx Meeting Server builds 3.0 Patch 1 and later.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds available. However, users can remove completely all WebEx software by using tools and procedures provided by CISCO:\n\n * On Windows systems, via the Meeting Services Removal Tool [3].\n * On Mac systems, via the Mac WebEx Meeting Application Uninstaller [3].\n * On UNIX/Linux systems, by following the steps in the Cisco Collaboration Help [4].\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180502-webex-rce>\n\n[2] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180502-war>\n\n[3] <https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396>\n\n[4] <https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX28548>\n",
