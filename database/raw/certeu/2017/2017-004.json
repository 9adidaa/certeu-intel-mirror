An attacker that can convince an affected user to visit an attacker-controlled web page or to open a crafted HTML page with the affected browser, could exploit the vulnerability. If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with the privileges of the affected browser [2].\n\n# Products Affected\n\nThis vulnerability affects all versions of Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft's Edge on Windows systems.\n\nProject Zero researcher Ivan Fratric reported the bug to Microsoft on 25/11/2016. It was made public on 28/02/2017, in line with Google's policy of publishing vulnerability details 90 days after being privately reported [2].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nAs no patch is available yet, it is highly recommended to avoid using Internet Explorer 11 or Microsoft's Edge on Windows for the time being. Microsoft has not provided a date for a patch release.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0037>\n\n[2] <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1011>\n",
