The vulnerability exists due to use of a hard-coded cryptographic key to encrypt the configuration file in FortiClient for Windows. An attacker with access to the configuration (or its backup) can decrypt the file using this default cryptographic key. The vulnerability can also be explited remotely, by an authenticated user of the system, where the configuration file resides [2].\n\nCurrently there is no exploit publicly available.\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThis vulnerability affects Fortinet FortiClient for Windows below 6.4.0.  \n\n# Recommendations\n\nUpgrade to FortiClient for Windows version 6.4.0 or above.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-19-194>\n\n[2] <https://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/vdb/SB2020060203>\n\n[3] <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16150>\n",
