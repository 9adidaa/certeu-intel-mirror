For this reason, it is highly recommended to patch the exposed PAN-OS devices as soon as possible.\n\n# Technical Details\n\n**CVE-2020-2040 (CVSS Score: Base 9.8)**\n\nA buffer overflow vulnerability in PAN-OS allows an unauthenticated attacker to disrupt system processes and potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges by sending a malicious request to the Captive Portal or Multi-Factor Authentication interface. This issue does not impact the GlobalProtect VPN or the PAN-OS management web interfaces [4]\n\n**CVE-2020-2036 (CVSS Score: Base 8.8)**\n\nA reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the PAN-OS management web interface. A remote attacker able to convince an administrator with an active authenticated session on the firewall management interface to click on a crafted link to that management web interface could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the administrator's browser and perform administrative actions [1].\n\n**CVE-2020-2041 (CVSS Score: Base 7.5)**\n\nAn insecure configuration of the appweb daemon of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS 8.1 allows a remote unauthenticated user to send a specifically crafted request to the device that causes the appweb service to crash. Repeated attempts to send this request result in denial of service to all PAN-OS services by restarting the device and putting it into maintenance mode [5].\n\n**CVE-2020-2037 (CVSS Score: Base 7.2)**\n\nAn OS Command Injection vulnerability in the PAN-OS management interface that allows authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges [2].\n\n**CVE-2020-2038 (CVSS Score: Base 7.2)**\n\nAn OS Command Injection vulnerability in the PAN-OS management interface that allows authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges [3].\n\n**CVE-2020-2042 (CVSS Score: Base 7.2)**\n\nA buffer overflow vulnerability in the PAN-OS management web interface allows authenticated administrators to disrupt system processes and potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges [6].\n\nPalo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities [1-6].\n\n# Products Affected\n\nThese vulnerabilities affect several versions of PAN-OS:\n\n* PAN-OS 10.0;\n* PAN-OS 9.1;\n* PAN-OS 9.0;\n* PAN-OS 8.1;\n\nFor specific affected versions, please refer to the Palo Alto security page [7].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating the vulnerable applications and systems or applying workarounds as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2036>\n\n[2] <https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2037>\n\n[3] <https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2038>\n\n[4] <https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2040>\n\n[5] <https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2041>\n\n[6] <https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2042>\n\n[7] <https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/>\n",
