This vulnerability allows **remote attackers** to **execute arbitrary code** on affected installations of Oracle WebLogic. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. This bug, assigned with CVE-2020-2883, is now being reported by Oracle as being **actively exploited in the wild** [5].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability was initially assigned with CVE-2020-2555 and patched by Oracle in January 2020 [2]. On 15th of January 2020, CERT-EU has issued **Security Advisory 2020-004** that addressed, among others, CVE-2020-2555 as well [3].\n\nHowever, according to Zero-Day Initiative, the patch made available in January by Oracle **can by bypassed** [4]. The specific flaw exists within the Oracle Coherence library. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to **execute code** in the context of the **service account**. This by-pass has been patched in the April by Oracle as CVE-2020-2883. This vulnerability is now reported to be under active exploitation [5].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe vulnerability exists in Oracle WebLogic Server, versions 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0, 12.2.1.3.0, 12.2.1.4.0 [1].\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended to apply the necessary patches from the April Oracle Critical Patch Update [1] as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html>\n\n[2] <https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html>\n\n[3] <https://media.cert.europa.eu/static/SecurityAdvisories/2020/CERT-EU-SA2020-004.pdf>\n\n[4] <https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2020/5/8/details-on-the-oracle-weblogic-vulnerability-being-exploited-in-the-wild>\n\n[5] <https://blogs.oracle.com/security/apply-april-2020-cpu>\n",
