Apache HTTP Server is prone to an open-redirection vulnerability because it fails to properly validate the redirect URLs. Specifically, this issue affects the `mod_rewrite` configurations. An attacker can leverage this issue by constructing a crafted URI and target a user to follow it.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nApache HTTP Server is prone to an open-redirection vulnerability because it fails to properly validate the redirect URLs. _Redirects_ configured with `mod_rewrite` that were intended to be self-referential might be fooled by encoded newlines and redirect instead to an unexpected URL within the request URL [1].\n\nWhen an unsuspecting victim follows the link, he or she may be redirected to an attacker-controlled site. The attack could have serious impact and the probability that this vulnerability to be exploit is very high [2].\n\nThe vulnerability received the number CVE-2020-1927. Note: This is the same defect as CVE-2019-10098. The fix for CVE-2019-10098 was\nineffective [2].\n\n# Products Affected\n\nIt affects Apache HTTP servers versions from 2.4.0 to 2.4.41.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nApache Server Project has released a patch for this vulnerability [3]. It was fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.42. It is strongly advised to update to the version 2.4.42 to patch this vulnerability as soon as possible.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIn case an immediate update is not possible there is a possible mitigation [2]:\n\n- anchor captures used as back-references,\n- prefix self-referential redirects with `/` or scheme, host, and port.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10098#vulnCurrentDescriptionTitle>\n\n[2] <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2020/q2/3>\n\n[3] <https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html>\n",
