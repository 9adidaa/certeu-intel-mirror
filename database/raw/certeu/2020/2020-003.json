Some the vulnerabilities are quite critical, so it is extremely important to **apply the patches as soon as possible**.\n\nA vulnerability identified as CVE-2020-0601 is affecting the Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI enabling a malicious software to appear as authentically signed by a trusted or trustworthy organisation. Other vulnerabilities, identified as CVE-2020-0609, CVE-2020-0610, and CVE-2020-0611 respectively, are affecting the Windows Remote Desktop Server and Client, and could lead to remote code execution [2].\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability CVE-2020-0601 exists in the way the Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI (`crypt32.dll`) validates Elliptic Curve Cryptography certificates [1]. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using a spoofed code-signing certificate to sign a malicious executable, making it appear the file was from a trusted, legitimate source. A successful exploit could also allow the attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks and decrypt confidential information on user connections to the affected software.\n\nThe vulnerabilities CVE-2020-0609 and CVE-2020-0610 affecting the Windows Remote Desktop Gateway Server could allow remote code executions by an unauthenticated attacked thanks to specially crafted requests. These vulnerabilities do not require user interaction [3, 4]. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\nThe vulnerability CVE-2020-0611 affecting the Windows Remote Desktop Client could allow a remote code execution on the client computer. To do so, an attacker needs to have control of a server and convince a user to connect to it. Then, the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the computer of the connecting client [5].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nAn overview of the affected products is presented below. For detailed list of affected versions, please consult [1, 3, 4, 5].\n\nMicrosoft Windows CryptoAPI vulnerability - CVE-2020-0601 [1]:\n\n* Windows 10 for 32-bit Systems and x64-based Systems\n* Windows Server 2016 and 2019\n\nWindows Remote Desktop Server vulnerabilities - CVE-2020-0609, CVE-2020-0610 [3, 4]:\n\n* Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, and 2019\n\nWindows Remote Desktop Client vulnerability - CVE-2020-0611 [5]:\n\n* Windows 10 for 32-bit Systems and x64-based Systems\n* Windows 8.1 for 32-bit and x64-based Systems\n* Windows 7 for 32-bit and x64-based Systems (SP1)\n* Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, and 2019\n* Windows Server 2008 R2 for Itanium-based and x64-based Systems Systems (SP1)\n\n# Recommendations\n\nMicrosoft has released patches to address these vulnerabilities. It is highly recommended to apply these critical patches as soon as possible, first on critical systems, internet-facing systems and network servers, and then on other affected assets.\n\nNSA has issued also its recommendations for mitigating actions [6], which may be used as a guideline if enterprise-wise automatic patching is not possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0601>\n\n[2] <https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-014a>\n\n[3] <https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0609>\n\n[4] <https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0610>\n\n[5] <https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0611>\n\n[6] <https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jan/14/2002234275/-1/-1/0/CSA-WINDOWS-10-CRYPT-LIB-20190114.PDF>\n",
