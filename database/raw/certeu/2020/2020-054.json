According to Oracle, this bug is linked to the vulnerability **CVE-2020-14882** [2]. However, Oracle did not provide any information about the relation between both of the security flaws. The CVE-2020-14750 vulnerability could allow a non-authenticated attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nOracle did not provide any technical information about the vulnerability. However, some sources believe the CVE-2020-14750 patch addresses a bypass of the CVE-2020-14882 patch, released some days ago [3].\n\nAs a reminder, **CVE-2020-14882** vulnerability involves different weaknesses in the way the server handles user-supplied requests. An attacker could send a simple HTTP GET request to exploit the vulnerability, execute code and get full control on the server [4].\n\n# Affected Products\n\nThe vulnerability exists in Oracle WebLogic Server, versions [1]:\n\n- 10.3.6.0.0,\n- 12.1.3.0.0,\n- 12.2.1.3.0,\n- 12.2.1.4.0,\n- 14.1.1.0.0.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended to apply the necessary patches from the October Oracle Critical Patch Update [1] as soon as possible and to look for any indicator of compromised on your network, beginning with firewall logs.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2020-14750.html>\n\n[2] <https://media.cert.europa.eu/static/SecurityAdvisories/2020/CERT-EU-SA2020-053.pdf>\n\n[3] <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-issues-emergency-patch-for-critical-weblogic-server-flaw/>\n\n[4] <https://testbnull.medium.com/weblogic-rce-by-only-one-get-request-cve-2020-14882-analysis-6e4b09981dbf>\n",
