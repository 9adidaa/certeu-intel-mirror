One of them is impacting Windows client version of *Cisco Webex Teams* [2]. The vulnerability is a DLL Hijacking Vulnerability and could potentially be used by an attacker with a foothold on a system to have another user execute a malicious DLL when *Cisco Webex Teams* starts.\n\nThere is no known attacks leveraging this vulnerability or proof-of-concept available for now.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nThe vulnerability was assigned *CVE-2020-3535* with a CVSS score of 7.8 [3].\n\nThere is no technical details available outside of the initial advisory from Cisco. Based on the description, the vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of directory paths at run time -- meaning that an attacker can place a malicious file in a folder with write access for everyone and have the application execute it when starting.\n\nIf a high-privileged user of the system starts the application, the attacker can escalate his/her privileges on the system.\n\n# Products Affected\n\nThis vulnerability affects the following Cisco Webex Teams Client for Windows versions:\n\n* 3.0.13464.0 through 3.0.16040.0\n\nNon-Windows versions are not affected.\n\n# Recommendations\n\nCERT-EU recommends updating Cisco Webex Teams Client for Windows to the latest version as soon as possible.\n\n# References\n\n[1] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x>\n\n[2] <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-teams-dll-drsnH5AN>\n\n[3] <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3535>\n",
